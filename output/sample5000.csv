développement humain de 0,302 en 2004. La pauvreté touche presque la moitié de la
population (46,4%) et est accentuée en milieu rurale (52,3%). La situation sanitaire se
caractérise en particulier par des taux élevés de mortalité et de morbidité et par un faible
accès aux soins de santé de base pour des raisons financières, géographiques, et culturelles.
Cette situation est aggravée par une insuffisance qualitative et quantitative du personnel. Le
taux de mortalité infantile de 83 pour mille naissances vivantes est dû principalement à la
malnutrition et aux maladies infectieuses. Le paludisme représente une des principales
causes de morbidité (en moyenne 600 000 cas par an selon l?UNICEF) et sévit de façon
endémique de même que les infections respiratoires aiguës et les diarrhées. La mortalité
maternelle (484 décès pour 100 000 naissances vivantes) est due aux faibles taux de
couverture en consultation prénatale et obstétricale. L?infection du VIH se caractérise par sa
stabilisation et touche toutes les couches sociales.
Face à cette situation, le Gouvernement du Burkina Faso a élaboré un cadre stratégique de
lutte contre la pauvreté en 2000 et révisé la même année sa politique sanitaire nationale
(PSN). Ce qui a permis au Ministère de la santé (MS) d?élaborer, en concertation avec les
acteurs de la santé et les partenaires au développement, un plan national de développement
sanitaire (PNDS) pour la période 2001-2010. En vue de suivre la mise en ?uvre du PNDS,
un Comité de suivi a été mis en place de même qu?un Secrétariat technique. Le PNDS met
la priorité sur la décentralisation du système de santé selon le modèle du district sanitaire, la
lutte contre la maladie, la promotion de la santé de la mère et de l?enfant, le renforcement de
la couverture en infrastructures sanitaires, le développement des ressources humaines, la
mobilisation des ressources en faveur de la santé.
En vue de mettre en ?uvre le PNDS, le Gouvernement a fait appel à ses partenaires, dont la
Banque africaine de développement, à qui une requête de financement du présent projet a

Myanmar is one of the poorest countries in the East Asia and Pacific Region, with an estimated gross domestic product per capita of between US$500-800. While reliable poverty data are scarce in Myanmar, all indicators point to poverty being concentrated in rural areas: two rounds of household surveys (in 2005 and 2009) supported by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) highlight significant differences in poverty across geographical areas, with rural poverty considerably higher than urban poverty. Available figures also suggest that social indicators are poor; with for example 32 percent of children under five suffering from malnutrition, the highest rate in the region. Agriculture is the mainstay of the national economy, generating 43 percent of gross domestic product, 54 percent of employment and providing livelihoods to more that 70 percent of the population. However, the sector is characterized by a number of constraints, including limited irrigation; little value added agro processing capacity, poor policy settings, and widespread indebtedness in rural communities.

It contributed to the key operational objectives of reducing poverty, enhancing food security and nutrition, and reducing vulnerability to recurrent shocks, thus contributing to WFP's Strategic Objectives 3 and 4. This was done through four main components:

Component 1, Improving Maternal and Child Nutrition (IMCN), aims to break the inter-generational cycle of undernutrition in Bangladesh. Following national guidelines and corporate strategies, WFP implements a targeted supplementary feeding programme (TSFP) for the treatment of moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) and provides children aged 6-59 months with Super Cereal Plus (WSB++) and pregnant and lactating women (PLW) with a premix of Super Cereal (WSB+) and fortified vegetable oil. TSFP is accompanied by behavior change communication (BCC) activities on nutrition and hygiene, thus combining treatment and prevention measures. Blanket supplementary feeding programme (BSFP) for the undocumented refugees from Myanmar was also planned for children (Super Cereal Plus) and PLW (Super Cereal and fortified vegetable oil) as explained in the beneficiaries, targeting and distribution section.

Component 2, School Feeding, aims to contribute to the Government of Bangladesh's overall goal of achieving universal primary education by increasing enrolment and attendance of pre-primary and primary schoolchildren through distributing nutritious biscuits and essential learning packages, and by providing technical support to the government. The School Meals Initiative, launched in 2013 in collaboration with the government to test an alternative modality, provides cooked meals to schoolchildren. Through the McGovern-Dole contribution, a literacy component is integrated into the programme.

Component 3, Enhancing Resilience to Natural Disasters and the Effects of Climate Change (ER), aims to enhance the resilience and food security of vulnerable communities and households through the creation of community assets. It focuses on achieving four key aspects: physical and environmental resilience, social resilience, economic resilience, and capacity enhancement of ultra-poor women and men and their families. Participants work to construct or repair community assets and take part in comprehensive training sessions; in return they receive cash. Particularly vulnerable woman participants benefit from a one-off cash grant for investment in income-generating activities, a monthly living allowance and follow-up support. The government directly funds 95 percent of the participants and WFP provides technical support to help enhance the quality of services.

Component 4, Strengthening Government Safety Nets (SGSN), aims to help the government enhance social safety nets addressing hunger and household food insecurity by providing technical assistance to the Vulnerable Group Development (VGD) programme and by implementing a promotional safety net in Cox's Bazar district titled Enhancing Food Security and Nutrition (EFSN) as well as an operational research project titled Targeting the Ultra Poor-Nutrition (TUP-N). The latter is a research initiative that sets out to examine if child stunting can be prevented by delivering a livelihoods support programme to ultra-poor women with small children.

The Program is intended to scale up the existing malaria interventions and consolidate on the gains made by the program to further reduce malaria transmission in the general population. This will be achieved by maintaining a strong focus on case management and diagnosis as well as preventive measures. The prevention strategy will emphasize ""scaling up for impact"" by ensuring high coverage of LLINs in the general population. Indeed the wide scale distribution of insecticide treated nets has been a significant contributing factor to the 35% decline in mortality of children under five between 2000 and 2004 (Masanja et al. 2008).
The Program will be managed by the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW) through the National Malaria Control Program, a department under the MOHSW. The objectives of the program are:
a)	To improve early recognition of malaria and access to effective diagnosis and case management through proper diagnosis of malaria and provision of Prompt, effective anti-malarial treatment;
b)	To prevent infection with malaria by maintaining high coverage of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs), with specific emphasis on vulnerable groups, complemented by other preventive community outreach methods such as control of malaria during pregnancy and Behavioral Change Communication (BCC); and
c)	To strengthen the surveillance system, operational research and program management. 

Additionally, the cross-cutting HSS interventions in the Program will strengthen the MOHSW and community support for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria through improved service delivery, program integration and information systems. The cross cutting interventions will include a well defined and responsive BCC strategy in line with the need to reinforce key malaria control messages as well as tailor these to a changing context of reduced malaria transmission and its potential impact on behaviors and vulnerabilities.

Yet, 870 million of people suffer from hunger and malnutrition. This ?paradox? ? which His Holiness Pope Francis I called it ?intolerable?, when he addressed the delegates of FAO Conference at the Vatican on June 20th - is caused by multiple factors. As of now, policies to confront hunger have been based principally on centrally-led and short-term relief approaches with a focus mainly on increasing food production through sectorial and pro-growth policies, thus resulting in overall modest effect on reducing hunger and malnutrition (MDG1) and increasing disparities and inequalities among people and geographic areas at the sub-national level.
There is increasing recognition that territorial approaches provide a suitable framework to address the structural and emerging issues of food and nutrition security, including widening within-country inequalities and disparities in so far as they allow the exploration of the multi-dimensional, multi-actor and multi-level nature of food and nutrition security. By recognizing the diversity of geographic spaces and of their capacity to react to shocks (external and internal), they are also suitable to tackle the sources of inequality. This involves among other things strengthening and harnessing the potential of local institutions and putting them at the forefront of the battle against food insecurity problems in order to ensure the achievement of the triple objective of equity, economic efficiency and environmental sustainability. 
The main objective of the initiative is to provide practitioners and policy-makers of developing countries involved in the design, implementation and evaluation of FSN and rural poverty reduction policy with a practical and evidence-based reference book that would enable them to understand why territorial approaches to policy-making may be more suitable to address food and nutrition insecurity problems, how territorial approaches can be implemented in practice and what are the prerequisite for these approaches to be effective.","False","False","Transaction",,"XM-DAC-41301-632316",932,"fao"

LBP also requested to: a) utilize additional funds generated from the appreciation of the Japanese yen against the Philippine peso since loan approval in 2006, and b) reallocation of loan proceeds from Part 2 (capacity development) to Part 1 (subproject investment) to fund additional sub-projects in the pipeline. A supervision mission was carried out in February 2012 to review the request, including the implementation schedule, implementation arrangements, and reallocation of project resources across categories, and revised disbursement targets during the extension period. The mission and LBP concluded that extending the project by 20 months will be sufficient to complete 14 ongoing sub-projects worth JPY 2.30 billion (Php 1.29 billion) and 3 sub-projects under procurement amounting to JPY 173.45 million (Php 97.13 million). It will also allow the Project to demonstrate the implementation of private sector-initiated investments for local development, including a pipelined engineered sanitary landfill worth JPY 712 million (Php 401 million), which is viewed as a long-term solution to the garbage problem of Metro Manila.","False","False","Budget",2,"44000-P064925",905,"ida"

El Encuentro reunirá a profesionales de instituciones culturales públicas y privadas, a entidades y personas interesadas en la materia y a jóvenes profesionales y estudiantes, además de a toda la ciudadanía comprometida con temas culturales. Se organizarán cuatro bloques temáticos: 1- el marco jurídico del Patrimonio y del mecenazgo cultural. El apoyo económico a la Cultura desde el sector público; 2- iniciativas desde el ámbito privado: el patrocinio, el asociacionismo, el voluntariado cultural y otras colaboraciones público-privadas. Un bloque 3 se dedicará a la presentación de experiencias concretas de gestión cultural, integradoras y sostenibles, que hayan contribuido eficazmente al desarrollo socio-económico de las poblaciones afectadas. Un último bloque se destinará a la presentación de proyectos culturales que buscan financiación. Se trata de un Encuentro de cuatro días (uno por bloque), a realizar previsiblemente durante el mes de noviembre de 2012. El proyecto terminará con una muy rigurosa evaluación de sus resultados en los seis meses posteriores al Encuentro. El intercambio entre profesionales iberoamericanos que ya cuentan con una trayectoria en políticas de mecenazgo y los profesionales de la Cultura peruanos redundará en la promoción de actitudes responsables y comportamientos efectivos a la hora de aplicar y desarrollar la Ley y el mecenazgo. Este tipo de encuentros es también muy adecuado para acercar a profesionales, entidades y potenciales patrocinadores, pudiendo ser el origen de nuevas colaboraciones.

Ansökande organisation:
Diakonia är en biståndsorganisation med kristna värderingar, vars huvudmän är frikyrkorna Svenska Alliansmissionen och Equmeniakyrkan. Diakonia har haft ramavtal med Sida sedan tidigt 1990-tal. Statusen som ramorganisation förnyades i början av 2014, efter att en ramkriteriebedömning genomförts. Diakonia har fyra regionkontor och 24 landkontor i Afrika, Asien, Latinamerika och Mellanöstern. 

Ansökan:
Ansökan utgör en förlängning av pågående ramprogram 2012-2014. Ansökan är inte komplett i sig själv, utan presenterar endast förändringar i förhållande till pågående program. Uppgifter som saknades i ansökan har Sida begärt in i efterhand från Diakonia. Bl.a. gäller det ett uppdaterat resultatramverk, en kostnadseffektivitetsanalys, en motivering av höjningen av budgeten samt en uppdaterad insatslista. Budgeten är inte korrekt uppställd, då indelningen av budgeten i verksamhetskostnader hos Diakonia respektive hos lokala samarbetsparter inte följer Sidas riktlinjer.

Ansökan omfattar 20 landprogram i Afrika, Asien, Latinamerika och Mellanöstern samt två regionala program i Afrika. Verksamheten är inriktad på fem tematiska områden: mänskliga rättigheter, demokrati, jämställdhet, social och ekonomisk rättvisa samt fred och försoning. Diakonia arbetar genom lokala samarbetsorganisationer. Totalt 233 ingår i denna ansökan. Kapacitetsutveckling av dessa utgör en viktig del av insatsen.

Diakonias övergripande mål är att förändra de politiska, ekonomiska, sociala och kulturella strukturer som skapar fattigdom, förtryck och våld. Diakonia stöder en bred krets av civila samhällesorganisationer med utgångspunkt från sin förändringsteori som fokuserar på medvetenhet och kunskap om rättigheter, mobilisering samt kollektivt agerande och påverkansarbete.

Förväntade resultat:
Förväntade resultat specificeras per land/regionalt program. Det är stora skillnader mellan programmen i hur resultaten utformas. Sida bedömer att de förväntade resultaten i flera fall är på en väl övergripande nivå, men de indikatorer som anges konkretiserar dem och gör dem uppföljningsbara. Exempel på förväntade resultat, ett från varje region, inom några vanliga tematiska områden är:
""Kenya: Förbättrad tillgång till rättslig prövning för rättighetsbärarna.""
""Peru: Andinska lantbrukarorganistioner och urfolksorganisationer i Amazonas genomdriver sina kollektiva rättigheter för hållbart nyttjande av naturresurser och för att minska sårbarheten vad gälller klimatförändringar, på ett jämställt, rättighetsbaserat och interkulturellt sätt, genom att utveckla sin kapacitet för påverkansarbete och för att skapa och genomföra alternativa förslag.""
""Bangladesh: Jämställdhet har stärkts och fördomar relaterade till kön har minskat"".
""Libanon: Diakonias partners har stärkt sin organisationskapacitet och tematiska kunskap."" 

Tidigare resultatuppfyllelse:
Sidas bedömning, baserat på tidigare erfarenhet och ramkriteriebedömningen är att Diakonia har god förmåga att uppnå resultaten. Resultatrapporteringen pekar ofta på resultat i termer av att rättighetsbärare har blivit stärkta och kapacitet hos samarbetsorganisationer har ökat. Exempel på tidigare resultat inom ett par områden:
- Demokrati: I Burkina Faso har samarbetspartners arbetat med att demokratisera gruvindustrin bl.a. genom kompetensutveckling och informationskampanjer. Det finns nu ett starkt engagemang för att eliminera barnarbete i gruvorna.
- Jämställdhet: Kvinnoorganisationer i Bolivia, Peru och Colombia har utvecklat elva förslag på lagar och policys för att skydda kvinnors rättigheter. Förslagen berör områden som kvinnors rätt till land, trakasserier och politiskt våld mot kvinnor, trafficking och kvinnors deltagande vid fredsförhandlingar.

Outside C.A.R, as of November 2014, more than 420,000 refugees, returnees, and third country nationals have taken refuge in neighboring Cameroon, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and Republic of Congo (RoC). Populations arriving in Cameroon came with no belongings; adults and children arrived with illnesses and injuries, and many suffering malnutrition after a long journey without food, water, or shelter. In Chad, the population profile was mixed, including both refugees and a large proportion of persons considered by the Chadian government to be returnees. In DRC, refugees settled in remote territories, where they lacked reliable livelihoods or coping mechanisms to meet basic food needs and, in host areas with an already precarious food security situation. Similarly, refugees arriving in RoC, who showed signs of moderate and acute malnutrition, were settled in two sites. 

Regional Emergency Operation 200799 (EMOP) responds to the life-saving needs of populations affected by the ongoing crisis in C.A.R. and its regional impact in Cameroon, Chad, DRC and RoC. The regional operation focused on ensuring life-saving needs of vulnerable populations in conflict-affected communities, the displaced and refugee/returnee sites. The operation is in line with Strategic Objective 1, ""Save lives and protect livelihoods in emergencies"" and aimed to: (i) improve food consumption and access to markets; (ii) stabilize undernutrition; and (iii) restore access to basic services. Elements fostering social cohesion, investment in human capital, and support for agricultural production alongside partners are integrated into the life-saving response.

In 2015 the social-political environment in C.A.R. remained extremely complex, and was characterized by continued sporadic surges of extreme violence against a backdrop of a survival economy and fragmented armed groups. The crisis led to large population displacements and severe humanitarian and economic implications as livelihoods and trade were disrupted or destroyed. Household assets and reserves were being depleted and the scale and severity of food insecurity levels among the population became unprecedented. Volatile security, inaccessibility, restrictions on movement and reduced presence of staff and partners in field locations remained important obstacles to meeting targets. Against this backdrop, the EMOP aimed to: (i) refine and re-focus targeting based on latest assessments - with a focus on rural areas; (ii) diversify activities and modalities to provide flexible seasonal support to moderately food-insecure households; (iii) support restoration of access to basic services and human capital protection; (iv) strengthen and stabilize the WFP country and sub-office staffing structure; and (v) reinforce supply chain management and alternative corridors to meet high monthly tonnage requirements.
The regional focus allowed to reaffirm visibility and a common advocacy around the crisis and its regional implications, while supporting a more equitable distribution of resources across the five countries. Beyond the programmatic response, the regional lens also reinforced a broader view of supply chain management of the operation, recognizing shared challenges and opportunities.","False","False","Budget",2,"XM-DAC-41140-200799-SNRB",966,"wfp"

PRRO operations from areas affected by the Casamance conflict to all regions of Senegal. The new transitional PRRO 200681 for the period of 2015-2016 was approved by the Executive Board in November 2014. It succeeds PRRO 200138 which ended in December 2014, and concentrates on localized relief, recovery and resilience support, paving the way to a longer term programme to follow. The PRRO 200681 is aligned with the Plan Senegal Emergent, and contributes to the Sahel 2014-2016 Strategic Response Plan, the United Nations Development Assistance Framework and WFP's Regional Resilience Roadmap for West Africa. It supports Strategic Objectives 2 (Support food security and nutrition and (re)build livelihoods in fragile settings and following emergencies); 3 (Reduce risk and enable people, communities and countries to meet their own food and nutrition needs); and 4 (Reduce undernutrition and break the intergenerational cycle of hunger). It further contributes towards Millennium Development Goals 1-5 and 7 and feeds into the ""Plan Senegal Emergent"".

The PRRO assists the country by adopting a twin track approach to address food insecurity in communities affected by shock combined with recovery and resilience support, and treating Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) where prevalence exceeds 10 percent, as well as preventing it where it exceeds 15 percent. It also strengthens national preparedness and response capacities with integrated early warning systems and response tools.

The operation seeks to facilitate stronger linkages between WFP's investments in relief, recovery and resilience-building initiatives to help the most vulnerable break out of the cycle of hunger.

In Casamance, where the household economy approach analysis confirmed the importance of school meals as a safety net for poor households, the PRRO supports school meals activities in preschools and primary schools to reduce dropouts. It also aims to facilitate the return of displaced people, providing resettlement packages.

In 2015 relief activities included targeted food and voucher distributions (Targeted Food Assistance- TFA) during the lean season, and Targeted Supplementary Feeding (TSF) for children under five and Pregnant and Lactating Women (PLW) as a treatment to Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM), and in response to the 2015 Strategic Response Plan and the government's appeal for urgent assistance.

Recovery activities comprised: school meals, Blanket Supplementary Feeding for children under two and PNW as a prevention of acute malnutrition, the creation of Village food Security Stocks (VSS), building of assets under the Food Assistance for Assets programme and the Rural Resilience Initiative.

The creation of VSS aims to facilitate access to cereals by communities during the lean season and contain price speculation. It also encourages communities to manage future cereal harvests and stocks more effectively. Stocks are allocated to vulnerable communities with the condition that they will aim at replenishing them with a reasonable percentage agreed by the community members themselves.

Under FFA insecure communities receive food, cash or vouchers to cope with the hunger season, depending on seasonal activities. At the same time, by participating in assets building activities they benefit from long lasting improvements in their food security and livelihoods. FFA is implemented either as standalone activity or as part of the Rural Resilience Initiative (R4), which combines food and cash assistance with asset creation, insurance, credit and savings schemes. The R4 jointly implemented by WFP and OXFAM America aims at improving food security and making farmers thrive. WFP has moved progressively from in-kind delivery to cash-based transfers which support all interventions at the exception of nutrition and VSS exclusively supported through food.","False","False","Transaction",,"XM-DAC-41140-200681",966,"wfp"

Climate change threatens the coffee production in Central America as the temperature rise and rainfall fluctuation endanger the whole industry in many areas. In addition the rust disease has seriously hit the whole region cutting around a quarter of the harvest. Damages caused by the rust disease have also reduced the employment of seasonal workers. During the project?s planning phase in 2014, the coffee producers identified as their major problems - in addition to climate change and the rust disease - cooperatives? weak governance, low productivity, lack of quality control, shortage of working capital and difficulties in market access.  The goal of the Guatemalan project is to improve livelihood of small-scale coffee producers. The project?s purpose is to develop the country's coffee producer organizations to be more efficient and productive. The project develops producer organizations? governance by developing strategic plans for producer organizations and supporting production of gender equality policies and deployment of those. Productivity of coffee will be improved by making farm management plans, increasing organic fertilizers? production, by setting up nurseries to replace coffee plants and by establishing demonstration plots with special focus on adaptation to climate change. Quality of coffee will be improved by training technicians on repair and maintenance of processing machines. In addition, the project will develop funding opportunities and facilitate market access by training on market knowledge. The project includes all 15 Fairtrade coffee producer cooperatives of Guatemala. These cooperatives are responsible for around 3,4 percent of Guatemalan coffee production and their export volumes are between 5 and 50 containers per year. The direct beneficiaries of the project are around 15.000 coffee producers, of which 17 percent are women. The project implementation began in late 2014.

Constraints include the lack of information reaching farmers, along with the availability and affordability of high-quality seeds, fertilizers, and Rhizobium inoculants. This project aims to resolve these limitations to make the technologies accessible to 100,000 small-scale farmers from six districts across Tanzania.

Increasing awareness and adoption
The project team will use a multimedia approach to inform half a million farmers about the benefits of the improved legume technologies. Tactics include interactive radio campaigns, social media, smartphone messaging, and voice telephony. Researchers expect that approximately 20% of farmers will adopt the new technologies. 

The team will also conduct subsidized farm-level trials, hold farmer-to-farmer demonstrations, and organize field days. 

Hub agro dealer model 
The project will use a hub agro model, which places agricultural dealers at the centre of their communities. This allows smallholder farmers to reduce transportation costs and makes inputs available locally.

The project team will train at least 30 hub agro dealers on the technologies so they can instruct a larger number of smaller-scale agro dealers operating across the target regions. Research partners will develop local capacity to ensure that the Tanzanian radio stations, designers, and writers can run similar campaigns in the future.

Innovation in legume technologies
By improving yields and reducing production costs, the project will increase family incomes and contribute to better nutrition of rural and urban households in Tanzania. This will allow them to consume a wider variety of legumes rich in protein and nutrients.

Verksamheten syftar till fattigdomsbekämpning genom att stärka det civila samhället inom huvudsakligen demokrati och mänskliga rättigheter, jämställdhet, hälsa, försörjning och utbildning.
Utvecklingssamarbetet genomförs i ett trepartssamarbete mellan Pingst FFS/PMU och lokal samarbetspartner och svenska pingstförsamlingar. Lokala samarbetspartners utgörs av lokala pingstkyrkor eller civilsamhällsorganisationer, ofta med kopplingar till en lokal kyrka.

Sidas bedömning av kapacitet och verksamhet gäller utifrån ovan PMU Interlife som en del av Pingst FFS. De utvärderingar som även utgör underlag för beredning och beslut har granskat PMU Interlife och inte hela Pingst FFS.

Sida har samarbetat med Pingst FFS/PMU i egenskap som ramorgansiation sedan 1980. I april 2014 fattade Sida beslut att inte bevilja Pingst FFS fortsatt status som ramorganiastion. Beslutet baserades på Sidas samlande erfarenhet samt en större ramkriteriebedömning genomförd av Sipu på uppdrag av Sida. För att säkerställa en ansvarsfull utfasning som ramorganisation till Sida, har Sida beslutat att bereda ett treårigt bidrag till Pingst FFS 2015-2017. Pingst FFS har i kontakter med Sida framfört att de inte planerar att fasa ut sin verksamhet, utan förbereder för en omställning med finansiering från andra källor från och med 2018. Sida ser en fortsatt dialog och plan för denna omställningsprocess som prioriterad under perioden, vilket återspeglas i dialogmål och avtalsvillkor. Under hösten 2014 har InDevelop på uppdrag av Sida genomfört en extern utvärdering av Pingst FFS/PMU med syftet att följa upp systemrevisionen från 2010 samt Pingst FFS/PMUs åtgärder för att få en uppdaterad bild av Pingst FFS/PMUs kapacitet. Utvärderingen bekräftar en positiv utveckling hos Pingst FFS/PMU, framför allt gällande intern styrning och kontroll samt bedömning av partners kapacitet genom avtalsrevisioner och riskbedömning. En del brister kvarstår dock framför allt gällande implementering och uppföljning av åtgärder (Dox 043916/14).

Ansökan visar att Pingst FFS fortsätter att utveckla sin verksamhet, system och rutiner för att stärka relevans och rättighetsbaserat arbetssätt, vilket bland annat synliggörs genom den nu fullt implementerade omställningen till tematiska program. Sida bedömer denna utveckling som positiv. Utifrån Sidas bedömning av den senaste rapporteringen och av ansökan kvarstår dock fortfarande flera brister.

Pingst FFS har inkommit med en ansökan för utvecklingssamarbete i syd och öst 2015-2017 med en total ansökt budget på 233 700 000 SEK. Verksamheten genomförs huvudsakligen genom nya eller redan pågående projekt med tidigare samarbetspartners. Ansökan innehåller samarbete med 36 samarbetspartners, av vilka tre är nya jämfört 2014. Verksamheten delas in i fem tematiska program och genomförs i 28 länder. En förändring mot tidigare perioder är att Pingst FFS avser att förstärka sin fältnärvaro i länder med större samarbeten. Denna utveckling planeras att pågå under ett antal år och kommer på sikt även innebära att en mindre andel resurser kommer att användas för verksamheten vid huvudkontoret i Sverige.

Programmet har ett femårigt perspektiv men begäran om finansiering rymmer perioden 2014-2016. Detta är i linje med tidigare diskussioner mellan ambassaden och Diakonia.

Huvudsyftet med programmet är att stödja framväxten av ett pluralistiskt och oberoende civilt samhälle som arbetar för att främja god sämhällsstyrning och demokratiskt deltagande. Insatsen avser att främja ett aktivt medborgarskap genom inkluderandet av ett rättighetsperspektiv, samt en förändringsteori som betonar ökad medvetenhet, organisering och gemensamma åtgärder, och opinionsbildning. Detta i sin tur i syfte att förbättra möjligheter för enskilda individer att aktivt delta i planering och genomförande av utvecklingsinsatser som gynnar dem, samt stärker deras rättigheter.

För att uppnå målen kommer Diakonia att ge ekonomiska bidrag och kapacitetsutveckling till ett antal lokala partnerorganisationer. För år 2014 är antalet 13. I linje med förändringsteorin kommer Diakonia att stödja organisationer i det civila samhället som vill utvecklas till att bli mer pluralistiska, mer representativa, mer självständiga, mindre elitistiska, mer jämställda, och mer demokratiskt organiserade.

Insatsen täcker tre övergripande resultatområden: 1) demokrati, 2) jämställdhet, 3) mänskliga rättigheter. Att försvara grundläggande mänskliga rättigheterna, där de är i riskzonen, samt främja demokratiska värderingar är centrala principer. Ett särskilt fokus läggs på mötes-, förenings- och yttrandefrihet. Detta tillsammans med andra initiativ som försöker motverka begränsningar i målgruppens demokratiska rättigheter. Användandet av informationsteknologi kommer att vara ett viktigt verktyg för kommunikation, evidensbaserad opinionsbildning och insamling av data, samt ett sätt att organisera målgrupperna.

Den föreslagna finansieringsformen är gåva. Detta bedöms som lämpligt för den typ av
kapacitetsutvecklingsstöd som Diakonia genomför. Eftersom det inte finns programbaserade alternativ kommer insatsen att genomförs som projekt. Diakonia kommer att vidareförmedla delar av medlen till tredje part (dvs.lokala CSOs). Sverige är för närvarande den enda givaren. Samordning mellan givare och andra intressenter är dock fortfarande relevant för att dela information, god praxis och erfarenheter och för att undvika överlappande verksamhet.","True","True","Transaction",,"SE-0-SE-6-5110006901-KHM-15160",10,"SE"

Union to Union (f.d. LO-TCO Biståndsnämnd) ansöker om rambidrag för 2017 på 135,1 MSEK för projekt och programverksamhet i utvecklingsländer och Östeuropa, inklusive administrations- och vidareförmedlingsbidrag där den totala budgeten uppgår till 153,0 MSEK inklusive en egeninsats på 14 %. Ansökan avser en ettårig förlängning av den verksamhet som genomförs under avtalsperioden 2014-2016. Vid en jämförelse av det sökta beloppet för 2017 och anslaget för 2016 på 119,9 MSEK (enligt andra avtalsändring av underavtal daterat 2016-11-21) motsvarar det ansökta beloppet en ökning på knappt 13 %. Union to Union förklarar ökningen främst med hänvisning till ett par gemensamma faktorer inom verksamhetens 11 sektorer. Den första rör valutakurser, där den svenska kronan tappat i förhållande till både CHF (Swiss Franc) och USD. Den andra faktorn är förknippad med att deras samarbetsparter drabbats av att andra givare dragit ner sitt stöd till den fackliga verksamheten medan behoven har kvarstått. Därutöver lyfter man att det krympande utrymmet för civilsamhället att verka innebär större utmaningar än tidigare. I ansökan för 2017 finns också ett par nya initiativ föreslagna i form av ett policyprogram avseende Agenda 2030 och den fackliga rörelsen (1 MSEK) och en s.k. Innovationsfond (0,5 MSEK) med syfte att kunna möta oförutsedda behov under året.

Union to Unions vision för verksamheten är att det i alla länder finns oberoende, demokratiska och jämställda fackliga organisationer som har kapacitet att företräda sina medlemmars intressen. De vill uppnå detta genom att arbeta med erfarenhetsutbyten och utbildning i fackliga och mänskliga rättigheter i arbetslivet, ledarskap inom fackliga organisationer, arbetsmiljö, jämställdhet, social dialog och hiv/aids.

Sida beslutar att bevilja Union to Union 120 MSEK för verksamheten 2017. Skälen är följande:

	Sida bedömer att Union to Union är en viktig aktör inom det fackliga arbetet och stödet till arbetstagarorganisationer i utvecklingsländer genom sitt globala nätverk av fackliga organisationer (Global Union Federations) och sin plattform i Sverige genom de svenska medlemsorganisationernas fackförbund. 

	Sida bedömer att den i ansökan 2017 föreslagna verksamheten är relevant under strategin Stöd genom svenska organisationer i det civila samhället 2016-2022 (CSO-strategin) eftersom att den relaterar till strategins övergripande syfte ""att arbeta för ett livskraftigt och pluralistiskt civilt samhälle i utvecklingsländer"" och till strategins båda övergripande målområden, dvs. 1) Stärkt kapacitet hos det civila samhället i utvecklingsländer och 2) Främjande av ett gynnsamt samhällsklimat för civilsamhället i utvecklingsländer. 

	Union to Union har varit ramorganisation till Sida sedan 1977 och Sidas erfarenhet av samarbetet med Union to Union är överlag god. 

	Då ansökan avser en ettårig förlängning av den verksamhet som genomförs under avtalsperioden 2014-2016 bedömer Sida att nivån på anslaget för 2017 bör ligga på ungefär samma nivå som anslaget för 2016. Givet den samlade bilden på anslaget bedömer Sida att Union to Unions ansökan om höjt anslag på ca 13 % inte föranleder Sida att höja anslaget för 2017. Sida föreslår att bidrag till den s.k. Innovationsfonden inte beviljas då presenterat underlag inte uppfyller kraven i Sidas insatshanteringsregel.

Då ansökan för 2017 avser en förlängning av verksamheten under avtalsperioden 2014-2016 bereds insatsen som ett kompletterande insatsbeslut. Sida har därför i så stor utsträckning som möjligt utgått från den beredning som gjordes av ansökan för avtalsperioden 2014-2016. I den utsträckning som denna bedömts vara fortsatt relevant har bedömningen behållits och endast en kompletterande kommentar gällande 2017 har lagts till.

The ARTF is critical to efforts to build a more functional and representative government system that successfully delivers services to Afghan citizens.  The ARTF consists of two funding channels. (i) As the Government of Afghanistans revenues are so far insufficient to cover its operating budget, the Recurrent Cost Window provides funding for salaries for non-uniformed government employees and for operating and maintenance (O&M) expenditures, to enable the Government of Afghanistan to undertake delivery and administration of essential services. (ii) The Investment Window provides funding for priority programs in agriculture, rural development, infrastructure, human development, and public sector capacity and governance.  The ARTF is administered by the World Bank in close consultation with the Government of Afghanistan and donors. Through the Recurrent Cost Window, expenses claimed by the Government of Afghanistan must meet eligibility criteria established by the World Bank and be verified by an independent, international, third-party monitoring agent before being reimbursed by the ARTF. As with all budget support initiatives, Canada is working in close cooperation with the World Bank, other donors, and the Government of Afghanistan to promote effective, transparent, and accountable country systems; to increase donor coordination and harmonization; and to strengthen mutual accountability. Budget support initiatives also foster greater policy dialogue among donors, government, and partners, thus helping to strengthen efforts towards effective, focussed aid and long-term development results.

The goal of the Quality Protein Maize Development (QPMD) project is to develop, produce, and promote the use of new varieties of maize that are reinforced with protein, and are thus much more nutritious than traditional varieties. Quality Protein Maize (QPM) is a maize genotype developed specifically to address the problem of poor protein quality in staple foods. QPM has twice the concentration of lysine and tryptophan than conventional maize, making its protein quality comparable to that of milk. QPM therefore has a tremendous potential to improve nutrition and health.

We Effect har inkommit med en ansökan om rambidrag för 2017 på sammanlagt SEK 188 033 400 för en ettårig förlängning av det program som genomförs under ramanslaget 2014-2016. Sida har därför beslutat att bereda insatsen som ett kompletterande insatsbeslut. Sida bedömer att ansökan är relevant under den nya strategin för stöd genom Svenska organisationer i det civila samhället (CSO-strategin) 2016-2022 och beslutar om ett bidrag om 180 000 000 SEK. Denna beredning har genomförts i samarbete mellan handläggare Eva-Lotta Gustafsson och USAID:s sekondering till Sida Joshua Haynes.

Ansökande organisation: 

We Effect är en ideell, partipolitiskt och religiöst obunden organisation vars syfte är att stärka medlemsbaserade och demokratiska organisationers förmåga att göra det möjligt för fattiga kvinnor och män att förbättra sina levnadsvillkor, försvara sina rättigheter och bidra till ett rättvist samhälle. We Effect bildades 1958 och har varit ramorganisation sedan 1978 under namnet Kooperation Utan Gränser. Organisationen är en demokratiskt strukturerad förening och bakom We Effect står ett sextiotal medlemsorganisationer från den svenska konsument- och producentkooperationen. We Effect är en väletablerad organisation i det svenska samhället, med ett öppet och demokratiskt arbetssätt - och med en stark internationell förankring.

We Effects vision är en hållbar och rättvis värld fri från fattigdom och organisationen arbetar inom landsbygdsutveckling och bostäder, inkluderat rätten till mark, jämställdhet och finansiella tjänster. Ansökan omfattar 17 program på regional eller landnivå och ett globalt program som totalt består av 160 projekt i 24 länder. 

Sida beslutade 2014 att förnya We Effects status som ramorganisation. 

Ansökan:

Ansökan bygger på We Effects prioriteringar och följer logiskt på tidigare verksamhet. We Effects ramansökan för 2017 är en fortsättning på det ramprogram som genomförs under pågående ramavtal 2014-2016.

Syftet med stödet är att stärka partnerorganisationen som sådan och att detta i sin tur ökar organisationens förmåga att å ena sidan påverka och kräva förändring på makronivå/strukturell nivå och, å andra sidan erbjuda medlemmarna efterfrågade tjänster. Enligt We Effects förändringsteori genomförs den huvudsakliga verksamheten av partnerorganisationerna. Inom programmen för landsbygdsutveckling stödjer We Effect bondeorganisationer i deras arbete med att öka sina medlemmars inkomster och tillgång till mat genom t.ex. jordbruksrådgivning, stärkt position på marknaden och hjälp med förhandlingar om priser. Organisationen förespråkar ett hållbart och klimatanpassat jordbruk och stödjer också lokala spar- och kreditföreningar som gör det möjligt för lantbrukare med små resurser att spara och låna pengar samt få tillgång till försäkringar. Inom bostadsprogrammen arbetar We Effect med lokala bostadskooperativ där medlemmarna tillsammans bygger sina bostäder. Kooperativen bedriver påverkansarbete för tillgång till bostadskrediter och säkrad rätt till mark att bygga på. Jämställdhet är ett prioriterat område för We Effects verksamhet. We Effect strävar efter att integrera jämställdhet i all verksamhet och organisationen stödjer partnerorganisationernas arbete med att stärka kvinnors rättigheter, bland annat genom kvinnligt ledarskap, en mer rättvis arbetsfördelning i jordbruket samt genom att försvara kvinnors rätt till mark. 

Målgruppen för We Effects utvecklingssamarbete är kvinnor och män som lever i fattigdom och som är medlemmar, eller potentiella medlemmar, i kooperativa organisationer, andra demokratiska föreningar eller informella grupper vilka arbetar för att uppnå gemensamma mål.

Förväntade resultat:

We Effects ansökan har resultatmatriser på land- och regional nivå, med indikatorer och utgångsvärden. På global nivå finns en resultatmatris men utan aggregerade utgångs- och målvärden. Ansökan har följande mål:

Aligned with United Nations Joint Vision for Sierra Leone and WFP Strategic Objectives 2, and 4 of the Strategic Results Framework, the CP focused on increasing access to basic education, improving nutrition, and livelihood. The CP, with the exception of food and nutritional support to ART clients and their households, was put on hold in June 2014 when the Ebola outbreak prevented large gatherings and resulted in movement restrictions and a collapse of non-Ebola related health services. WFP was not able to resume the majority of the CP activities due to the continued presence of the virus through most of 2015 and the ongoing discussion with government over programme resumption and implementation. 

Improving the quality of and access to education are priorities of the government under pillar three of the Agenda for Prosperity (A4P). WFP aimed to support this pillar through component 1 of the CP, the school feeding programme. In order to bridge the gender gap, the CP intended to provide a take home ration as an incentive for parents to send their girls to school and to keep them there.  The school feeding programme and take home ration was not resumed in 2015 due to ongoing discussions with the government for the roll-out of a government-led national school feeding programme. 

Overall, the population of Sierra Leone has a poor nutritional status attributable to the high levels of stunting and micronutrient deficiencies at varying levels across the country. Component 2 of the CP intended to focus on providing nutritional support to malnourished and vulnerable children aged 6-59 months, pregnant and lactating women (PLW) through targeted supplementary feeding, ART clients and their households through targeted supplementary feeding, and complementary feeding for children aged 6-23 months. Supplementary feeding through health centers for moderately acute malnourished children and PLW was significantly disrupted as capacity to provide healthcare services outside of Ebola was unavailable, combined with community fear of health facilities. In November, the targeted supplementary feeding programme (TSFP) was resumed and expanded under the CP to include both children age 6-59 months and pregnant and lactating women (PLW). Complementary feeding was removed under the Budget Revision as other nutrition interventions were considered to have a larger impact and greater coverage. 

Despite the suspension of the CP activities, malnourished ART clients continued to receive food-by-prescription while their families received household food support.  This helped to ensure that this already vulnerable group continued to receive support throughout the Ebola outbreak so that ART adherence and nutritional status was maintained. 

In order to address the poor infrastructure which continues to threaten food security, the CP aimed to build agricultural assets and helped to achieve adequate food consumption levels mostly through the Cash for Assets (CFA) programme. As agriculture is a core pillar in the A4P and the government's Poverty Reduction Strategy for 2013-2018, the CP supported agricultural growth through component 5 of the government's Smallholder Commercialization Programme. However, like other CP activities, the livelihoods component was put on hold from June 2014 due to the Ebola outbreak and was not resumed in 2015.","False","False","Transaction",,"XM-DAC-41140-200336",966,"wfp"

Still, their participation is well below men's, and the rate of increase is slowing down. 

Despite high economic growth, falling income inequality, poverty reduction, and improvements in women's education, women continue to be at a disadvantage for job opportunities and working conditions. These inequalities suggest that women face gender-based constraints. These may be based on rules, customs, beliefs, and values. They may also be the result of institutions that reproduce these inequalities. Among women, there are also strong differences. Uneducated and poor women participate less in paid work.

Different policies have tried to tackle these gender disparities. Policies to foster employment have focused on promoting entrepreneurship through support for micro-enterprises. There remains a key gap, however. Policies designed to improve the quality of jobs for women who are already employed are scarce, and their impact is not clear. The region has expanded social protection programs, yet how these programs support women's economic empowerment and labour market participation is disputed. Some argue that social protection programs can reinforce traditional women's roles while others argue that they enhance women's autonomy and empowerment.

This project seeks to explore these issues, and more specifically, the determinants of women's labour market participation. Researchers will examine the constraints that explain occupational segregation (i.e., fields of work occupied mostly or only by women), precarious work, and low-income levels. They will analyze the consequences on poverty, inequality, and growth. They will apply an innovative mix of research methods and analytical approaches to provide in-depth insight into the way gender-based constraints operate in different contexts, and what can be done to transform them. The project will help strengthen skills and knowledge in the area of gender, labour market, and social policy analysis and evaluation among policymakers, women's advocacy NGOs, and young researchers.

The project involves eight country case studies, regional and comparative research, and a call for impact evaluation studies, training, and dissemination activities. The findings will serve to improve the effectiveness of current policies to promote gender equality in labour markets and to ensure better economic opportunities for women. The Centro Interdisciplinario de Estudios sobre el Desarrollo, Uruguay, will lead the project, in collaboration with the Center for Distributive, Labour and Social Studies at Universidad Nacional de La Plata.","False","False","Transaction",,"XM-DAC-301-2-107474-001",301,"CA"

On one hand, occasional armed attacks in locations near the border with Liberia created a fragile security situation in the areas of origin of some of the refugees. On the other hand, the Cote d'Ivoire government had, during the Ebola outbreak in Liberia, suspended the return of refugees from Liberia to Cote d'Ivoire. With peaceful elections held in Cote d'Ivoire in November 2015 and the Ebola outbreak contained in Liberia, voluntary repatriation resumed in December 2015, with the first batch of more than 1,000 refugees returning to Cote d'Ivoire before the end of 2015.

The PRRO is a continuing response to a December 2010 request from the Government of Liberia for ""emergency food assistance in favour of Ivorian refugees who are presently seeking refuge in Liberia"". The government made the request to UNHCR who then passed it on to WFP in line with the corporate UNHCR/WFP 2011 Joint Memorandum of Understanding.

2013,259,"MZ",10,,110,"C01",56.5039742627,"Beyond Criminal Justice: Toward a New Paradigm for Political Settlement in Africa",152,15220,,"Mass violence in contemporary Africa typically occurs in cycles. Months or years after one wave of violence is brought to an end, another wave overtakes it. Peace agreements are swept away and yesterday's victims emerge as today's perpetrators. Research explains these cycles of violence by pointing to state and institutional weaknesses as perpetuating the violence. More precisely, the state and its institutions tend to fail to uphold the political settlement and promote broad-based public support for it. As a result, development agencies have invested billions of dollars into state-building enterprises based on the logic that a stronger state would be better positioned to escape the conflict trap. 

This project challenges this dominant perspective by arguing that it is not the state's weakness that has led to repeated cycles of mass violence in Africa, but rather that the very nature of the state-society relationship is to blame. Put simply, the answer lies in understanding how these cycles of violence are intertwined with how the modern African state has used ethnic politics to shape and divide society. 

The project also aims to determine the ways in which political settlements can provide a foundation for sustainable peace, or further polarize communities and set the stage for resumed conflict based on levels of inclusiveness. Its objectives include:
-to generate knowledge about political settlements that follow or precede episodes of mass violence;
-to expand options and expertise available to those negotiating political settlements and to the policy community;
-to develop a new generation of scholars who can actively participate in and guide African-initiated peace and justice processes; and,
-to enable Makerere Institute of Social Research in Kampala, Uganda, to establish itself at the center of academic and policy debates on peace-building and state-building issues.

The research team will conduct a comparative analysis of six cases: Uganda, Mozambique, Kenya (the Rift Valley), South Sudan (Darfur), Rwanda, and Burundi. They will demonstrate how divergent approaches to establishing a framework for peace can promote or break cycles of violence. In each case, researchers will test the hypothesis that political settlements that promote more inclusive political and social reform processes among communities of survivors provide the foundation for more durable and sustainable peace.","False","False","Transaction",,"XM-DAC-301-2-107453-001",301,"CA"

It contributed to the key operational objectives of reducing poverty, enhancing food security and nutrition, and reducing vulnerability to recurrent shocks, thus contributing to WFP's Strategic Objectives 3 and 4. This was done through four main components:

Component 1, Improving Maternal and Child Nutrition (IMCN), aims to break the inter-generational cycle of undernutrition in Bangladesh. Following national guidelines and corporate strategies, WFP implements a targeted supplementary feeding programme (TSFP) for the treatment of moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) and provides children aged 6-59 months with Super Cereal Plus (WSB++) and pregnant and lactating women (PLW) with a premix of Super Cereal (WSB+) and fortified vegetable oil. TSFP is accompanied by behavior change communication (BCC) activities on nutrition and hygiene, thus combining treatment and prevention measures. Blanket supplementary feeding programme (BSFP) for the undocumented refugees from Myanmar was also planned for children (Super Cereal Plus) and PLW (Super Cereal and fortified vegetable oil) as explained in the beneficiaries, targeting and distribution section.

Component 2, School Feeding, aims to contribute to the Government of Bangladesh's overall goal of achieving universal primary education by increasing enrolment and attendance of pre-primary and primary schoolchildren through distributing nutritious biscuits and essential learning packages, and by providing technical support to the government. The School Meals Initiative, launched in 2013 in collaboration with the government to test an alternative modality, provides cooked meals to schoolchildren. Through the McGovern-Dole contribution, a literacy component is integrated into the programme.

Component 3, Enhancing Resilience to Natural Disasters and the Effects of Climate Change (ER), aims to enhance the resilience and food security of vulnerable communities and households through the creation of community assets. It focuses on achieving four key aspects: physical and environmental resilience, social resilience, economic resilience, and capacity enhancement of ultra-poor women and men and their families. Participants work to construct or repair community assets and take part in comprehensive training sessions; in return they receive cash. Particularly vulnerable woman participants benefit from a one-off cash grant for investment in income-generating activities, a monthly living allowance and follow-up support. The government directly funds 95 percent of the participants and WFP provides technical support to help enhance the quality of services.

Component 4, Strengthening Government Safety Nets (SGSN), aims to help the government enhance social safety nets addressing hunger and household food insecurity by providing technical assistance to the Vulnerable Group Development (VGD) programme and by implementing a promotional safety net in Cox's Bazar district titled Enhancing Food Security and Nutrition (EFSN) as well as an operational research project titled Targeting the Ultra Poor-Nutrition (TUP-N). The latter is a research initiative that sets out to examine if child stunting can be prevented by delivering a livelihoods support programme to ultra-poor women with small children. WFP also works to mainstream fortified rice into national social safety nets and is working towards creating supply and demand on the market.","False","False","Transaction",,"XM-DAC-41140-200243",966,"wfp"

Esto que es recomendable en el mundo desarrollado es absolutamente necesario en países en desarrollo y es precisamente in situ donde menos se da. Las razones son principalmente económicas ya que no existe una infraestructura humana ni material que permita prestar unos servicios mínimos. Además, los medios como kits de análisis, equipos, etc., están diseñados para utilizarse en una sociedad hiperdesarrollada y en el otro mundo, frecuentemente, no hay un suministro eléctrico garantizado ni medios para adquirir kits de diagnostico o medicamentos. Esto hace que haya una gran prevalencia y que dadas las condiciones tan favorables para la propagación de enfermedades, estas lleguen a ser epidémicas. El modo de atajar tales males es disponer de vacunas, pero precisamente algunas de las enfermedades son tan significativas porque aún no existen vacunas efectivas. Por ello es de gran importancia disponer de medios efectivos de diagnostico clínico. Actualmente, lo kits de diagnostico utilizados requieren de personal entrenado, medios de almacenamiento (neveras) y ensayo (centrifugas, microscopios, detectores, etc.), inexistentes en muchos casos, y además son económicamente inasumibles. Nuestro grupo ha desarrollado y puesto a punto una metodología de ensayo basada en tecnología de disco compacto con características (portabilidad, gran capacidad de trabajo, reducido consumo de reactivos y necesidades mínimas de suministro eléctrico y mantenimiento) que la hace muy útil para su aplicación en las condiciones arriba señaladas.

Para ello, pretende fortalecer las capacidades locales, con especial énfasis en las adolescentes, para que, a través de su capacitación y abriendo espacios para su participación, puedan ser agentes de cambio. Los temas a tratar (Prácticas Familiares Esenciales, educación y protección de la infancia), se configuran como elementos de discusión para el diálogo y el cambio social. Estos temas, tradicionalmente ?permitidos? para las chicas, permiten, de una forma socialmente aceptable por parte de hombres y mujeres, dar pasos hacia una mayor voz y presencia social de las chicas y las mujeres, y hacia un cambio en las relaciones de género y los roles atribuidos a hombre y mujeres. Además, la adopción de medidas en cada uno de esos temas permite mejorar la supervivencia, el acceso a la educación y el fin de prácticas contrarias a la protección de las niñas, como puede ser el fin de los matrimonios prematuros. La duración total del proyecto es de 2 años (01/01/2013-31/12/2014), solicitando la subvención del Ayuntamiento de Pamplona para la ejecución prevista para el segundo año (2014). El objetivo general es mejorar la supervivencia, desarrollo y protección de la infancia, con especial incidencia sobre las cuestiones que afectan a las adolescentes, en la región de Maradi. Y el objetivo específico, conseguir la adopción de prácticas y normas sociales adecuadas en materia de protección y educación de las adolescentes y de supervivencia de la infancia en un proceso liderado y gestionado por la comunidad, especialmente por las adolescentes, en 63 pueblos de la comuna de Sarkin Yamma en la región de Maradi. Asimismo, los resultados son: Primero: Las adolescentes de los 63 pueblos seleccionados actúan como agentes de cambio en cuestiones de protección, educación y supervivencia de la infancia; Segundo: Las comunidades, familias, adolescentes y líderes tradicionales han recibido formación sobre Practicas Familiares Esenciales, derechos de la infancia y protección de las niñas, están a favor de su adopción en la vida diaria y controlan su implantación a nivel comunitario; y el Tercero: la población de las comunidades de intervención está sensibilizada y movilizada respecto a la supervivencia, protección y educación de la infancia y la adolescencia, gracias a la realización de campañas con alta participación de las adolescentes. La cooperación de UNICEF en Níger se inicia en el año 1982, tras la firma del Acuerdo Básico de Cooperación entre el Gobierno de Níger y UNICEF (acuerdo revisado en 1995).

Fängelserna i Kenya lider av kronisk överbeläggning som beräknas uppgå till det dubbla antalet intagna mot vad de är dimensionerade för. Överbeläggningen leder till att de intagna har svåra problem med hygien, sanitet, att vara privat, hälsan, våld mellan intagna, kontakter utanför fängelset och överlag en inhuman behandling från myndigheternas sida. Orsakerna till överbeläggningen är i huvudsak bristen på alternativ till fängelsedomar, bristen på möjligheter att få fängelsedomar ändrade till villkorliga straff och de extremt långa häktningstiderna. Till detta ska läggas bristen på åtgärder för övervakning vid villkorliga domar, rehabilitering och social integrering av intagna och f d intagna. Dessa brister leder i sin tur till hög återfallskriminalitet. Ett ytterligare problem är fängelsepersonalens mycket dåliga arbets- och levnadsförhållanden, vilka försvårar alla försök till att förbättra förhållandena för de intagna. 

Kriminalvårdens program syftar till att att genom ett nära samarbete med de kenyanska kriminalvårdsmyndigheterna, Kenya Prison Service (KPS) och Kenya Probation and Aftercare Service (KPAS) stärka dessa myndigheters kapacitet och ändra på rutiner och beteenden för att därigenom förbättra förhållandena för intagna och dömda, t ex att via stärkt kapacitet för övervakning minska på antalet intagna.

- att förbättra kapaciteten hos KPS att i en säker och human miljö använda ett behovsbaserat angreppssätt vid rehabilitering av intagna;
- att förbättra kapaciteten hos KPAS att utvecka ett mer effektivt och professionellt arbete med övervakning av villkorligt dömda.

Programmet är en gemensam insats mellan Sverige och Kenya där Sverige står för den direkta finansieringen av programaktiviteter medan Kenya ställer personer, lokaler, transporter mm till förfogande inom programmets ram. Det kommer att ledas gemensamt av Kriminalvården, KPS och KPAS under en ledningsgrupp bestående av två kenyanska programansvariga, två svenska rådgivare och en i Sverige-baserad programansvarig. Kriminalvården kommer att förse programmet med expertis och utbildare. Samarbete och samordning kommer att ske med Raoul Wallenberg Institutets (RWI) parallella, Sida-stödda program för att stärka den kenyanska kriminalvårdens respekt för mänskliga rättigheter. De två programmen kommer att ha en gemensam styrkommitté.","True","True","Budget",,"SE-0-SE-6-5111008001-KEN-15150",10,"SE"

Cameroon, Chad and Niger. In the beginning of 2014, numbers were relatively low and populations were supported under
WFP or partner existing activities. However, growing insecurity in 2014 led to important peaks in arrivals, in particular in August, bringing the need to activate a regional response. The continuation of widespread violence in Northeastern Nigeria and neighboring countries has caused massive population movements in the four Lake Chad Basin Countries with destruction of livelihoods and assets.

As the tensions in northern Nigeria intensified through 2015, there was a sharp increase in population displacement which further deprived chronically poor areas. Border countries therefore continued to support refugees, returnees, vulnerable host populations and internally displaced persons (IDPs) affected by the crisis.
Insecurity, displacement, disrupted agricultural activities, and cross border trade, which further undermined communities' livelihoods and led to a limited access to and availability of food. The disruption of farming activities in Cameroon, of trade and local farming in Chad and of the export of fish and livestock in Niger all contributed to an increasing level of food insecurity in the region.

By mid-October 2015, more than 4.7 million people were in moderate and severe food insecurity in Cameroon, Chad and Niger as well as Nigeria, the heart of the crisis.

In this context, in which the crisis has exacerbated the food insecurity of IDPs, refugees, returnees, and has greatly affected the coping strategies of local populations, the regional EMOP seeks to address these critical food and nutrition needs in the three Lake Chad Basin Countries (LCBC) of Cameroon, Chad and Niger. In Nigeria, as of September 2015, WFP signed memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) to provide capacity strengthening to their response to the crisis in the North East.

Specifically, the EMOP aims to:
(i) Ensure the food needs of crisis-affected populations through flexible and context-specific responses;
(ii) Stabilize the nutrition situation of crisis-affected children through robust prevention programmes adapted to nutrition indicators of population groups;

In line with the WFP Strategic Plan, the project contributes to Strategic Objective 1, ""Save lives and protect livelihoods in emergencies.""

Launched in January 2015, the regional emergency operation for the Lac Chad Basin supports populations displaced by the insecurity in northern Nigeria by the Boko Haram crisis. WFP has scaled up its operations throughout the year in response to multiple population movements resulting from cross-border attacks.

Under this EMOP, in response to rising food insecurity, malnutrition risks and continued displacement in the Lake Chad Basin, WFP aims at providing equitable assistance to the women and men within the refugee, IDP and local communities. Special efforts were made to provide a dedicated attention to gender considerations, in particular raising awareness to reduce the risk of sexual and gender-based violence in border areas and camps.

In Nigeria, in line with the MoU and in order to enable a hands on support by experienced WFP staff, WFP set up a base in Borno and Yobe Northern Nigerian states. Technical workshops on emergency management capacities were delivered to participants from national and state emergency agencies and partners.

WFP also supported the roll-out of the Cadre Harmonise regional food security classification framework in Nigeria. At the request of the Humanitarian Coordinator, in mid-2015 WFP launched United Nations Humanitarian Air Services (UNHAS) connecting humanitarian responders to the capital and northern states.","False","False","Budget",2,"XM-DAC-41140-200777-NE",966,"wfp"

The overall premise is that national innovation systems can only benefit the poor and other excluded sections of society when they do not rely entirely on formal science and technology (S&T) systems.

There is great demand for new information and community technology (ICT) services on the part of the local population and the various knowledge-intensive industries (tourism, financial services, outsourcing). Policymakers have shown interest in the potential of mobile phones as a way of delivering services to the poor. However, progress has been hindered lack of independent, critical, policy-oriented research in the region.

This project will attempt to address the problem in three components. The first component, Caribbean ICT Indicators, will endeavor to provide policymakers with basic indictors of ICT access and usage across the region. Using a common data collection instrument, researchers will investigate a number of core indicators. The survey will include two sets of questions on mobile and broadband access, respectively. The second component, Rethinking ICT Policy and Regulation, will examine policymaking and regulation formulation and their implementation across four jurisdictions: Barbados, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States. All these jurisdictions have implemented ICT reforms with varying degrees of success. The recommendations arising from this component will have both national and regional significance in terms of implementation and harmonization.

The third component, Mobile Opportunities 2.0: m-Fishery, will explore opportunities associated with the provision of mobile-enabled services to the poor. Given the region's established capacity in community-based management of coastal resources, this component will focus on small-scale fisheries. The sector has expressed keen interest in using mobile phones to deliver services related to resources management, boat safety during weather events and audio training. The Caribbean ICT Research Programme will include a competition for young researchers and a regional rapid response initiative designed to provide quick, expert advice to regional policymakers, regulators and others in relation to specific areas of interest. The Progamme is expected to constitute a substantial step toward the formation of a regional network of researchers able to accelerate the rise of the Caribbean knowledge economy.

Activities targeting rural and urban communities to alleviate hunger and reduce undernutrition as well as to enhance resilience were complemented by broader capacity development initiatives such as disaster risk reduction management and emergency simulation exercises.  

WFP's humanitarian assistance included the provision of food or cash-based transfers (CBT) to internally displaced persons (IDPs) and returnees affected by conflict, to people affected by economic stress or natural disasters, such as floods and landslides, as well as for the treatment of acutely malnourished children under five years of age and pregnant and lactating women (PLW). According to the Afghanistan National Nutrition Survey (NNS) 2013, 40.9 percent of children under five were chronically malnourished (stunted), 9.5 percent were acutely malnourished (wasted) and 24.6 percent underweight. 

The context of maternal and child nutrition status is characterised by a high prevalence of malnutrition, including micronutrient deficiencies, due to inadequate dietary intake, frequent infections and poor maternal outcomes. Maternal undernutrition is equally concerning with one-fifth of adolescent girls and women of reproductive age undernourished (low body mass index). Underweight women are more likely to give birth to low birthweight babies at higher risk of neonatal and infant death and stunted growth. The NNS 2013 showed that women and adolescent girls who had little or no formal education or came from impoverished households were more likely to be malnourished and deficient in essential micronutrients.

As part of its recovery strategy, WFP supported communities in their efforts to build productive assets that increase agricultural productivity and strengthen resilience to shocks. Additionally, WFP's recovery activities contributed to increased enrolment, attendance and learning capacity among primary and lower secondary school pupils through take-home rations, and among adults, particularly women, through vocational skills training activities.

Aligned with WFP Strategic Objectives 1, 2 and 4, the PRRO aimed to:

- respond to the food security and nutritional needs of IDPs and returnees affected by conflict, and people affected by natural disasters and economic stress (under Strategic Objective 1); 
- support the recovery of communities affected by shocks (under Strategic Objective 2); 
- treat moderately malnourished children under-5 and PLW (under Strategic Objective 4); 
- contribute to learning among primary and lower secondary school pupils and adults, particularly women (under Strategic Objective 4). 

Under capacity development, WFP's Purchase for Progress (P4P) initiative continued to procure locally produced high-energy biscuits (HEB) for emergency response, wheat grain from local small-holder farmer organizations and also to connect farmers with millers in order to create a sustainable institutional market for their surplus. This contributed to WFP's shift to more nutrition-sensitive entitlement baskets in mid-2015. WFP facilitated capacity development events for government staff, farmers and national counterparts. Training included major disaster response simulation exercises, with a focus on emergency preparedness and response capacity, food security analysis and disaster risk reduction (DRR).

-	Människors rätt till sexuell och reproduktiv hälsa och rättigheter har stärkts.
-	Människor som lever i utsatthet har rätt till grundläggande trygghet och har stärkt social och ekonomisk egenmakt.
-	Människor har fått ökad trygghet, möjlighet och egenmakt att hantera konflikter och delta i freds- och försoningsprocesser.
-	Kvinnor och män har förbättrade förutsättningar och möjligheter till jämställt deltagande, röst och ledarskap i kyrka och samhälle.
-	Människors rätt till kroppslig och sexuell integritet i kyrka och samhälle har stärkts. 

Svenska kyrkan har föreslagit en förlängning av insatsen, på basis av dess existerande resultatramverk, med en budget på 119 419 916 SEK för år 2017 vilket motsvarar en ökning om 23% jämfört med föregående år. Utifrån en samlad bedömning och med hänsyn till tillgängliga anslagsmedel föreslås i Sidas beredning att ansökan för 2017 finansieras med 105 000 000 SEK. Ny total budget för insatsen 2014-2017 blir därmed 396 000 000 SEK.

För år 2017 har Svenska kyrkan budgeterat för utbetalningar till lokala samarbetsparter till en summa på 108 523 921 SEK, varav 94 904 250 SEK ingår i ansökan för 2017 och resterande del är utbetalningar av Sida-medel som redan är avtalade inom Svenska kyrkans EU-projekt. Denna totala andel som vidareförmedlas uppgår till 70% av totala budgeten för ram-insatsen och den redan avtalade EU-insatsen, beräknat på andelen utbetalningar som går direkt till lokala parter som Svenska kyrkan har avtal med. Att Svenska kyrkan räknar in Sida-stödet till egeninsatsen till sitt EU-projekt i andelen som vidareförmedlas påverkar inte bedömningen av ansökan för 2017. För tydlighetens skull kommer dock Sida be Svenska kyrkan att redovisa Sida-stödet till EU-insatsen separat i nästa ansökan. Av de medel som vidareförmedlas 2017 kommer 46 MSEK fördelas till parter i Afrika (Etiopien, Liberia, Sydafrika, Sydsudan, Uganda och Zimbabwe), 11,5 MSEK till Asien (Indien och Burma/Myanmar), 23 MSEK till Latinamerika (Colombia, Guatemala, Honduras och Haiti), och 14,4 MSEK till Mellanöstern (Egypten och Israel/Palestina). Inga utbetalningar kommer att ske till internationella avtalsparter eller svenska CSO. 

De lokala samarbetsparterna uppgår till omkring 110 CSO och/eller CSO-nätverk. Storleken på bidragen varierar mellan 80 000 SEK till omkring 5 MSEK. Svenska kyrkan räknar Lutherska världsförbundets (LVF) lokala/nationellt registrerade landkontor bland sina lokala CSO-partners. Svenska kyrkans samarbete med de lokala LVF-programmen utgör en stor andel av det totala stöd som förmedlas  närmare 22 %. I förlängningsansökan 2017 motsvarar det totalt 24,5 MSEK. Av dessa går 282 000 SEK till ett globalt program som administreras av kontoret i Genève  alla övriga medel går direkt till LVF:s landprogram och det arbete dessa kontor bedriver självständigt i samverkan med lokala CSO. Med egna medel stödjer Svenska kyrkan utöver detta den koordinerande funktionen i Geneve med 4,9 MSEK 2017, vilket kommer det lokala arbetet till godo bland annat gällande kvalitetssäkring och utvärdering. Medan den koordinerande funktionen via LVF i Genève bidrar med kvalitetssäkring av LVF-projekten, genomför Svenska kyrkans personal kvalitetssäkringen av övriga projekt inom programmet.

Intercommunity conflict, civilian kidnappings and criminal activities persisted in many regions, and insecurity along roads and distribution sites continued to impede humanitarian access to certain areas. The unrest in Bangui in late September 2015 caused over 48,000 people to flee their homes at a time when thousands of displaced people were in the process of returning. According to UNHCR, as of November 2015, 447,000 people were internally displaced in C.A.R., 40 percent of them located in IDP sites. 
Outside C.A.R, as of November 2014, more than 420,000 refugees, returnees, and third country nationals have taken refuge in neighboring Cameroon, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and Republic of Congo (RoC). Populations arriving in Cameroon came with no belongings; adults and children arrived with illnesses and injuries, and many suffering malnutrition after a long journey without food, water, or shelter. In Chad, the population profile was mixed, including both refugees and a large proportion of persons considered by the Chadian government to be returnees. In DRC, refugees settled in remote territories, where they lacked reliable livelihoods or coping mechanisms to meet basic food needs and, in host areas with an already precarious food security situation. Similarly, refugees arriving in RoC, who showed signs of moderate and acute malnutrition, were settled in two sites. 

Regional Emergency Operation 200799 (EMOP) responds to the life-saving needs of populations affected by the ongoing crisis in C.A.R. and its regional impact in Cameroon, Chad, DRC and RoC. The regional operation focused on ensuring life-saving needs of vulnerable populations in conflict-affected communities, the displaced and refugee/returnee sites. The operation is in line with Strategic Objective 1, ""Save lives and protect livelihoods in emergencies"" and aimed to: (i) improve food consumption and access to markets; (ii) stabilize undernutrition; and (iii) restore access to basic services. Elements fostering social cohesion, investment in human capital, and support for agricultural production alongside partners are integrated into the life-saving response.

In 2015 the social-political environment in C.A.R. remained extremely complex, and was characterized by continued sporadic surges of extreme violence against a backdrop of a survival economy and fragmented armed groups. The crisis led to large population displacements and severe humanitarian and economic implications as livelihoods and trade were disrupted or destroyed. Household assets and reserves were being depleted and the scale and severity of food insecurity levels among the population became unprecedented. Volatile security, inaccessibility, restrictions on movement and reduced presence of staff and partners in field locations remained important obstacles to meeting targets. Against this backdrop, the EMOP aimed to: (i) refine and re-focus targeting based on latest assessments - with a focus on rural areas; (ii) diversify activities and modalities to provide flexible seasonal support to moderately food-insecure households; (iii) support restoration of access to basic services and human capital protection; (iv) strengthen and stabilize the WFP country and sub-office staffing structure; and (v) reinforce supply chain management and alternative corridors to meet high monthly tonnage requirements.
The regional focus allowed to reaffirm visibility and a common advocacy around the crisis and its regional implications, while supporting a more equitable distribution of resources across the five countries. Beyond the programmatic response, the regional lens also reinforced a broader view of supply chain management of the operation, recognizing shared challenges and opportunities.","False","False","Transaction",,"XM-DAC-41140-200799-CG",966,"wfp"

Policy research in South Asia is dominated by India. A long tradition of independent research exists there thanks to the strong demand from policymakers in search  of ideas and advice. Local funding is available, but as in other regions, this tends to be project-based and is moving away from support to the social sciences. Institutions are struggling to maintain high quality research and to communicate their results effectively.

This grant will strengthen the ability of the nine research institutions in India to provide, disseminate and communicate high-quality research. It will do so through measures aimed at enhancing the ability of staff to conduct sound research, improving organizational performance and forging links with policymakers. Particular effort will be made to enable grantees to mobilize other sources of funding, so that none become dependent on the Think Tank Initiative over the long term. The project will also support a platform for grantee networking both within the Initiative and with a wider network of institutions engaged in policy-related research.

Planted trees will provide harvest in the end of the dry season when food is scarce. The effect of malnutrition is worst in the most vulnerable groups: amongst children elderly and sick. Vitamins and nutritients from fruits are important addition to dry season nutrition intake. Fruit trees will be planted in depleted farm lands which are otherwise out of use. This will lead to reforestation in areas where the tree cover is now very low. Productive fruit tree is such a valuable asset for a farmer that it won't be cut but in an emergency so the project will sustainably increase carbon sequestration in the trees of the area. The main method of action is planting cashew and mango trees in villages that are capable of protecting the trees from fire. In our previous projects in the area we have reinforced fire control in 10 villages. From these 10 villages we will choose 500 beneficiary families or individuals through applications. We will also construct a tree nursery for seedling production which we expect to cover it's operational costs in second or third year. The first batch of seedlings for planting in five first villages in the first year will be bought from nearby Burkina Faso as there is no tree nursery in the nearby area. Second year will see the project implementation in three to four other villages for which the seedlings will be supplied by tree nursery production. In the third year we expect the biggest trees will start to produce fruit. Also we will start the project in the remaining villages re-plant in places where dead trees have occurred and if tree seedling production allows also plant in new communities which are ready to take necessary care of the trees.Main actions:1. Selecting beneficiaries that fulfill the requirements.2. Organizing trainings about nutritional benefits of fruit fruit tree care and fire control.3. Establishing a tree nursery.4.

Existe un % de mujeres que además ayuda en las labores del campo, pero sin retribución económica, lo que deriva en una falta de aporte monetario a la economía familiar. Se une la carencia de políticas de equidad de género casi en la totalidad de loa ámbitos. Casi no existen organizaciones civiles de mujeres ni cooperativas o microempresas dirigidas por ellas. Así que, a pesar de contar en la zona con las materias primas para que estas existan la realidad es contraria. Este hecho se debe también a que las mujeres de la zona no están formadas ni capacitadas en asociacionismo, cooperativas, manufacturas, etc. También se hace necesaria, al menos, poner las bases para futuras redes de intercambios (comerciales, de conocimientos, etc.) entre distintas asociaciones de mujeres. Respecto a los hombres, la mayoría de ellos se dedican a labores agrícolas, principalmente al olivar (aceituna y aceite). Sin embargo, el molino de aceite se encuentra lejos de la zona de intervención del proyecto y es más el dinero invertido en desplazamientos, tratamiento, etc., que el que finalmente se puede ganar con los productos derivados. Es necesario pues, poner en marcha un molino que de cómo fruto un aceite de oliva de alta calidad y con los requisitos necesarios para competir en el mercado. La zona de ejecución se encuentra en un paraje natural, así que es fundamental que las acciones vengan enmarcadas en el cuidado y la protección del medioambiente. Se harán campañas de sensibilización, se implementarán técnicas de agricultura ecológica; las instalaciones que se construyan en el marco del proyecto, serán 100% respetuosas con los estándares ecológicos. El molino contará además con un estanque para la gestión de aguas grises y negras. En este contexto se ha decidido focalizar la intervención en estos douares y actuar sobre 3 grandes ejes: 1. Mejora del acceso a la participación social y a los recursos económicos de las mujeres con un centro comunitario y un vivero y mejora de los derechos laborales y las competencias de las mujeres con la conformación de una Asociación y distintas capacitaciones. 2. Mejora del acceso al trabajo y aumento la capacidad de generar ingresos de los agricultores de la Comuna con un molino de aceite y fortalecimiento de las competencias profesionales en el ámbito de la organización, valorización y venta de productos agrícolas de los campesinos. 3.

In line with the United Nations Development Assistance Framework for Nepal, and the government's Three-Year Development Plan 2013-2016, the CP was implemented through three components and contributed to WFP Strategic Objectives 3 and 4.

The Productive Assets and Livelihoods component contributed to improve household food security and resilience. It provided seasonal employment and livelihood training that enabled rehabilitation of rural roads, irrigation channels and other community assets and acted as a safety net for rural households with low income. Through these projects, people were assisted in applying available resources in their community in more sustainable ways.

The Education Support component aligned with the government's School Sector Reform Programme, intended to provide children with an education of better quality. WFP provided school meals to pre-primary and primary schoolchildren with the purpose of keeping children in school and encouraging more children to be enrolled, both girls and boys, and improving their attendance. WFP also built school infrastructure, rehabilitated kitchens, latrines, and water stations. WFP distributed non-food items, particularly energy-saving stoves, cooking utensils and school furniture among others in an effort to assist the government in developing child-friendly schools that attract more children to study in a better learning environment. WFP worked in partnership with the Food for Education Project (FFEP) under the Ministry of Education.

The Nutrition Component provided support to the Ministry of Health and Population to prevent chronic malnutrition among pregnant and lactating women (PLW) and children aged 6 to 23 months through the Mother and Child Health and Nutrition (MCHN) programme. The specialised nutritious food ""Super Cereal"" was given to PLW and children, complemented with key messages on health, nutrition and hygiene habits. WFP also planned to support the government to treat moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) in children aged 6 to 59 months, in partnership with UNICEF under the Integrated Management of Moderate Acute Malnutrition (IMAM) programme. In addition, WFP supported a study on low birth weight in two districts which was concluded in 2015.

Capacity Development was provided across the three components, to strengthen the government's ability to implement these and similar programmes. In particular, WFP provided technical assistance and supported the institutionalisation of a national monitoring system known as the Nepal Food Security Monitoring System (NeKSAP) into government structures at the national and sub-national level. A key WFP contribution to augment the government's logistics and telecommunications capabilities was the humanitarian staging area (HSA) constructed under the Emergency Preparedness and Response (EPR) project with resources provided through a Trust Fund, in the Tribhuvan International Airport.

Despite increased openness to evidence-based policymaking, local funding for Latin American policy research institutions is extremely limited and often partisan.

This grant will strengthen the ability of the 12 selected research institutions to provide, disseminate and communicate high-quality research. This will be achieved through measures aimed at enhancing the ability of staff to conduct sound research, improving organizational governance, and communicating with policymakers. Particular effort will be made to enable grantees to mobilize other sources of funding, so that none become dependent on the Think Tank Initiative over the long term.

Rice is the most rapidly growing source of food in Africa. Both urban and rural populations have come to depend on it as a food staple that is easy to prepare, store and provides a high source of calories, making it an essential complement to good nutrition. In 2010, Africans consumed an estimated 26 million tons of rice, with an average per capita consumption rate of 24 kg per year. The formal African rice industry with its limited means for production is not able to meet this consumer demand with a yearly production of 16 million tons of rice.

The LVIF is a partnership between the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Global Affairs Canada (formerly Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada), and the International Development Research Centre. It represents a joint investment of CA$57 million over five years to support the development, production, and commercialization of innovative vaccines against priority livestock diseases in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia.

More specifically, the LVIF will support innovation and research to increase the efficacy, marketability, and use of existing vaccines, develop new vaccines against priority livestock diseases, and build effective research and public-private partnerships to accelerate the registration, commercialization, and use of vaccines. 

The research will also lead to a better understanding of disease dynamics and their impact, as well as the issues that constrain poor farmers from using vaccines. By bringing together all stakeholders - from farmers to researchers, pharmaceutical companies, and regulators - the LVIF will foster a vibrant and sustainable livestock sector in the target regions.

The previous PRRO featured capacity augmentation and policy development components to optimise the disaster response structures and policy frameworks of the Government of the Philippines in support of the Philippine Development Plan (2011-2016). As the Philippines consistently ranks high among the most disaster-prone countries in the world, a strategic and proactive approach to building resilience is crucial to mitigate the negative impacts of hazards and enable the swift return to socio-economic vitality following disasters.

The main goals of the operation were to:

- meet the food security and nutrition needs of women, men, girls, and boys affected by conflict and natural disasters in Mindanao; 
- enhance government and community disaster preparedness, and response systems at the national and some sub-national levels to ensure timely responses to natural disasters; 
- advise government departments on the development of gender-responsive food security and nutrition policies; and
- provide life-saving food assistance in response to disasters.

This PRRO complemented the Special Operation 200706, which aimed to enhance the disaster preparedness and response capabilities of the government. It also supported the ongoing programme of the Government in Central Mindanao to promote peacebuilding, reconstruction, and development in conflict-affected areas.

This project aims to extend the harvest and improve fruit quality and shelf life. It builds on an earlier Canadian International Food Security Research Fund project, which demonstrated that hexanal (a widely used biochemical compound) can be a successful tool for addressing the problem. 

Advancing science, enhancing fruit life
The project uses cutting-edge science to extend and optimize the use of hexanal for pre- and post-harvest applications to other commercial fruits, such as bananas, papaya, and citrus. Researchers will improve packaging systems for transporting fruit using hexanal impregnated bionanoparticles and biowax dip treatments. 

The Tamil Nadu Agricultural University in India, the Industrial Technology Institute in Sri Lanka, and the University of Guelph in Canada will work with research institutions in the West Indies, Kenya, and Tanzania to generate new knowledge on innovations with hexanal sprays, biowax, and nanopackaging materials. They will also look at opportunities for commercializing the technologies at scale.

Taking new technologies to market
Research on scaling up will identify suitable, practical methods for wide-scale adoption and market entry. Options include:
-producing nanofibre matrices for commercial use
-applying the technologies to larger volumes of fruits
-packaging for different market requirements
-extending the lessons from mangoes to other tropical fruits

The use of green nanotechnologies from biowastes, instead of metal- or carbon-based nanoparticles, is environmentally sustainable and lowers production costs. 

Improving lives and livelihoods
The project is expected to significantly reduce post-harvest losses, improving incomes and livelihoods for smallholder fruit farmers living in the five target countries. It is also expected to lead to new economic opportunities for women farmers engaged in post-harvest operations.

In Africa, CBPP threatens to affect the livelihoods of more than 24 million people in 26 countries, the majority of them small-scale farmers. While vaccines for CBPP are available, they are short-lived and require refrigeration, which makes them impractical in many parts of Africa.

This project is using a novel, genomics-based approach to develop an affordable vaccine for CBPP that is effective, safe, and easily produced, stored, and transported. Since eventual success depends on the vaccine's acceptability by livestock keepers, the project involves them in field-testing and assesses their willingness to pay for the vaccine. The project also examines how gender considerations may affect the distribution, cost, and packaging of the vaccine.

The project combines the vaccine expertise of Canadian researchers with the know-how of Kenya-based research institutes in infection and handling of cattle with CBPP. This research has the potential for large and visible impacts in numerous countries in Africa, and also in Canada, where the vaccine could become a model to protect livestock against other existing and emerging diseases.

The project is designed to use the findings of its applied research to influence national and regional policy affecting the African rice industry to ensure that agricultural policy considers the needs of all rice agricultural stakeholders, especially local farmers.   Rice is the most rapidly growing source of food in Africa. Both urban and rural populations have come to depend on it as a food staple that is easy to prepare, store and provides a high source of calories, making it an essential complement to good nutrition. In 2010, Africans consumed an estimated 26 million tons of rice, with an average per capita consumption rate of 24 kg per year. The formal African rice industry with its limited means for production is not able to meet this consumer demand with a yearly production of 16 million tons of rice. As a result, 40% of African rice consumers rely on global imports to satisfy their dietary needs.
