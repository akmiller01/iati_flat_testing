This project is based on the recognition that economic growth needs to be balanced with social inclusion. It seeks to build research capacity to frame regulatory policy governing nanotechnology in three South Asian countries: India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Building on an earlier project (104068), Indian researchers will endeavor to define the nature and scope of a minimum level of regulatory coordination and convergence needed for the country. In their national studies, researchers in Pakistan and Sri Lanka will focus on indigenous capabilities and the status of nanotechnology development in relation to development needs. The project is expected to help each country develop a framework for risk assessment and to result in a regional nanotechnology policy learning platform.

Despite increased openness to evidence-based policymaking, local funding for Latin American policy research institutions is extremely limited and often partisan. Except in Peru (and universities in general), policy research organizations are relatively young and face challenges common to newly established institutions anywhere: difficulties in establishing a focused research agenda, problems in attracting and retaining staff and governance issues.

This grant will strengthen the ability of the 12 selected research institutions to provide, disseminate and communicate high-quality research. This will be achieved through measures aimed at enhancing the ability of staff to conduct sound research, improving organizational governance, and communicating with policymakers. Particular effort will be made to enable grantees to mobilize other sources of funding, so that none become dependent on the Think Tank Initiative over the long term. The project will also support a platform for grantee networking both within the Initiative and with a wider network of institutions engaged in policy-related research.

Tuberculosis (TB) is a major public health problem in Bangladesh. The country ranks sixth on the list of the 22 high-burden TB countries. According to the WHO report ""Global Tuberculosis Control 2009: Epidemiology, Strategy, Financing"", the annual estimated incidence of all TB cases is 223 per 100,000 population, the incidence of new smear-positive cases is 100 per 100,000 population and the prevalence of all cases is 387 per 100,000 population. TB mortality is estimated at 45 per 100,000 population per year. 

This Program will be implemented through public-private partnership model by two principal recipients, namely, the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC), hereafter referred to as PR-2 or the Principal Recipient, and, at the time of signature of this Grant Agreement, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of the Government of Bangladesh (MoH&FW) through the Economic Planning Division of the Ministry of Finance of the Government of Bangladesh, hereafter referred to as PR-1. 

In collaboration with PR-1 and Sub-recipients, mainly Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), PR-2 has been implementing Directly Observed Treatment Short-course (DOTS) strategy since 1993 across all 64 districts covered and 460 sub-districts (upazillas) through Global Fund supported activities under Round 3 and Round 5 grants. According to programmatic updates of PR-2, the detection rate of new smear-positive cases has increased from 41% in 2003 to 46% in 2004 and from 61% in 2004 to 73% in 2008; the treatment success rate among new smear-positive patients has increased from 84% among patients diagnosed in 2003 to 92% in 2008. 

The Program was developed in order to bridge the identified gaps inadequately addressed by the National TB Programme in Bangladesh. These broad areas include diagnosis of smear-negative, extra-pulmonary and childhood TB, scaling up of Multi-Drug Resistant TB (MDR-TB) diagnosis and treatment, scaling up of private health care providers particularly in urban areas, expansion of Advocacy Communication and Social Mobilization (ACSM) activities and TB/HIV and health systems strengthening including Practical Approval to Lung Health (PAL).

The Productive Assets and Livelihoods component contributed to improve household food security and resilience. It provided seasonal employment and livelihood training that enabled rehabilitation of rural roads, irrigation channels and other community assets and acted as a safety net for rural households with low income. Through these projects, people were assisted in applying available resources in their community in more sustainable ways.

The Education Support component aligned with the government's School Sector Reform Programme, intended to provide children with an education of better quality. WFP provided school meals to pre-primary and primary schoolchildren with the purpose of keeping children in school and encouraging more children to be enrolled, both girls and boys, and improving their attendance. WFP also built school infrastructure, rehabilitated kitchens, latrines, and water stations. WFP distributed non-food items, particularly energy-saving stoves, cooking utensils and school furniture among others in an effort to assist the government in developing child-friendly schools that attract more children to study in a better learning environment. WFP worked in partnership with the Food for Education Project (FFEP) under the Ministry of Education.

The Nutrition Component provided support to the Ministry of Health and Population to prevent chronic malnutrition among pregnant and lactating women (PLW) and children aged 6 to 23 months through the Mother and Child Health and Nutrition (MCHN) programme. The specialised nutritious food ""Super Cereal"" was given to PLW and children, complemented with key messages on health, nutrition and hygiene habits. WFP also planned to support the government to treat moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) in children aged 6 to 59 months, in partnership with UNICEF under the Integrated Management of Moderate Acute Malnutrition (IMAM) programme. In addition, WFP supported a study on low birth weight in two districts which was concluded in 2015.

Capacity Development was provided across the three components, to strengthen the government's ability to implement these and similar programmes. In particular, WFP provided technical assistance and supported the institutionalisation of a national monitoring system known as the Nepal Food Security Monitoring System (NeKSAP) into government structures at the national and sub-national level.

De kan ha brist på mat och inte få i sig daglig näring i den utsträckning som möjliggör en dräglig vardag. De icke-optimal odlingsförhållanden kan vara miljöbetingade via olika sorters stress utifrån exempelvis vind, vatten, torka, salt, värme, kyla etcetera. Saltstress återfinns i Bangladesh i ett vidsträckt bälte kring landets kustområden och delvis inåt landet. Hög salthalt i jorden minskar möjligheterna för många växter att tillväxa optimalt eftersom vatten dels är svårare att ta upp och dels för att växter tar upp mer salter som i stora mängder kan sägas vara giftiga för växten. Växten får lägga energi dels på att ta upp vatten mer effektivt samtidigt som den får motarbeta förhöjda saltkoncentrationer i cellerna. För människorna betyder det också att utbytet av odling av grödor försämras och inte nyttjas optimalt och i slutändan leder det till undernäring och i värsta fall svält med dödsfall som resultat. Vad man gör är naturligtvis att förädla fram grödor som kan klara saltbördiga jordar bättre än andra grödor. Bl.a inriktar man sig på ris och vete i Bangladesh eftersom båda utgör en stor del av människornas föda i landet. Klassisk växtförädling har varit framgångrik sen ända sen människan började odla grödor. Meningen med klassisk växtförädling är att man korsar växter med olika egenskaper som man hoppas sen ska återfinnas i nästa generation, men man kan inte med säkerhet förutsäga vilka egenskaper som kommer föras över till nästa generation. I dagens moderna tidevarv med molekylärbiologiska och biotekniska applikationer kan forskare precist gå in och ändra så att man med större sökerhet kan få fram nya generationer av växter, så kallade genetiskt modifierade (GM), som innehåller egenskaper som efterfrågas, oftast också tidsbesparande. Men tveksamheter till GM växter i framför allt Europa har lett till att mycket av denna kunskap inte blommat ut fullt så som man skulle kunnat förvänta sig. Bland annat så är det svårt att få tillstånd till att odla GM växter. På grund av detta har vi valt att ta fram salttoleranta vetelinjer som inte är GM växter för att kunna få plantorna in i dagligt jordbruk utan eventuellt byråkratiska hinder. Den teknik vi kommer använda kallas för TILLING och utgår från att man behandlar frön från vete med en kemikalie kallad EMS som använts frekvent i svenskt jordbruk sen mitten av 1900-talet för att ta fram muterade växter. Men eftersom man inte tillför en gen eller tar bort en gen så går dessa behandlade växter ej under kriteriet GM växter. Med optimal titrering av EMS får man alla gener hos en större mängd vetefrön muterade. Dessa mutationer kommer ge upphov till nya egenskaper hos nästa generation. I vårt fall kommer vi leta efter tre egenskaper hos vete till att börja med: 1, tål hög salthalt i jorden; 2, har en hög proteinhalt i vetekornen; 3, har en hög andel kolhydrater som frigör energi långsamt. I första fallet är det för att kunna odla vete på jordar i Bangladesh som har hög salthalt. Vete kräver mindre vatten än ris och kan också odlas under flera årstider. Högre proetinhalt i kornen är för att den ökade koldioxidhalten i vår luft har bidragit till ca 10% minskad proteinhalt i vetekorn vilket har en negativ effekt för människor med vete som daglig huvudföda. En hög andel kolhydrater som frigör energi långsamt är bra för människor med diabetes, en sjukdom som även sprider sig snabbt bland befolkningen ibland annat Bangladesh. Det internationella samarbetet medför möjlighet till storskalig odling i Bangladesh under forskningen s fortskridande bland människor med stor kunskap om klassisk växtförädling.

Despite increased openness to evidence-based policymaking, local funding for Latin American policy research institutions is extremely limited and often partisan. Except in Peru (and universities in general), policy research organizations are relatively young and face challenges common to newly established institutions anywhere: difficulties in establishing a focused research agenda, problems in attracting and retaining staff and governance issues.

This grant will strengthen the ability of the 12 selected research institutions to provide, disseminate and communicate high-quality research. This will be achieved through measures aimed at enhancing the ability of staff to conduct sound research, improving organizational governance, and communicating with policymakers. Particular effort will be made to enable grantees to mobilize other sources of funding, so that none become dependent on the Think Tank Initiative over the long term. The project will also support a platform for grantee networking both within the Initiative and with a wider network of institutions engaged in policy-related research.

The Qinling Mountains are central to soil and water management of the Yangtze and Yellow rivers. The Project will improve biodiversity conservation and management by restoring forest habitat, improving endangered species management and providing sustainable livelihoods for the population of the project area, and demonstrating the benefits to the rest of the Qinling Mountains and other similar areas in the PRC. The Project will provide significant environmental, economic, and social benefitsthroughout the project area. It will address underlying causes and effects of historical and contemporary resource degradation.

The project area is 458 square kilometers (km2), about 45 kilometers southwest of Xi'an, the capital of Shaanxi, and is identified as the birthplace of the Taoist religion. The project area is divided into a plains area for ecotourism and agriculture development, and a mountainous area for biodiversity conservation. It is home to about 20,400 people. The plains have about 15,800 residents (77% of the total) who live on about 58 km2 (13% of the total project area) bordering the northern end of the project area. The poverty incidence is about 23%. This area also includes the township of Louguantai; several Taoist temples; the Qinling National Botanical Garden (QNBG) and nursery; the Shaanxi Animal Rescue Center (SARC), which includes threatened species of giant panda, golden monkey, golden takin, and crested ibis; and the Louguantai Forest Farm. About 71 million tourists visit Shaanxi province annually, of which about 400,000 visit the project area and about 1 million visit the Qinling Mountains. The larger but scarcely populated mountainous area is called the Qinling Biological Conservation and Demonstration Area (QBCDA), where the management objective is low-impact development that supports the conservation of biodiversity and provides sustainable livelihoods for about 4,600 residents (23% of total) on about 400 km2 (87% of project area).       

The Project will produce three primary outputs: (i) participatory biodiversity management in the mountainous area, (ii) enhancement of biodiversity conservation in the plains area, and (iii) improved project management. Using sustainable financing mechanisms for biodiversity conservation, the habitat of the mountainous area, QBCDA, will be improved to promote mixed forest coverage, and flora and fauna species expansion. The small population lives in scattered settlements in QBCDA and will be encouraged to support biodiversity conservation objectives and minimize unsustainable farming and other activities.    

The Project will develop biodiversity-based attractions that will generate funds for the management and enhancement of QBCDA. The commercial activities will involve a botanical garden, wildlife breeding and research (including a giant panda center second only to Sichuan province s Wolong Nature Reserve), and related ecotourism. QNBG will address a major weakness of the many past biodiversity projects by ensuring sustainable financing using part of the ecotourism revenue. Links with the Qinling Mountains nature reserves and an increase in biodiversity corridors will be pursued.","False","False","Transaction",,"46004-39321-013-LN2572",915,"asdb"

Ansökande organisation:
Diakonia är en biståndsorganisation med kristna värderingar, vars huvudmän är frikyrkorna Svenska Alliansmissionen och Equmeniakyrkan. Diakonia har haft ramavtal med Sida sedan tidigt 1990-tal. Statusen som ramorganisation förnyades i början av 2014, efter att en ramkriteriebedömning genomförts. Diakonia har fyra regionkontor och 24 landkontor i Afrika, Asien, Latinamerika och Mellanöstern. 

Ansökan:
Ansökan utgör en förlängning av pågående ramprogram 2012-2014. Ansökan är inte komplett i sig själv, utan presenterar endast förändringar i förhållande till pågående program. Uppgifter som saknades i ansökan har Sida begärt in i efterhand från Diakonia. Bl.a. gäller det ett uppdaterat resultatramverk, en kostnadseffektivitetsanalys, en motivering av höjningen av budgeten samt en uppdaterad insatslista. Budgeten är inte korrekt uppställd, då indelningen av budgeten i verksamhetskostnader hos Diakonia respektive hos lokala samarbetsparter inte följer Sidas riktlinjer.

Ansökan omfattar 20 landprogram i Afrika, Asien, Latinamerika och Mellanöstern samt två regionala program i Afrika. Verksamheten är inriktad på fem tematiska områden: mänskliga rättigheter, demokrati, jämställdhet, social och ekonomisk rättvisa samt fred och försoning. Diakonia arbetar genom lokala samarbetsorganisationer. Totalt 233 ingår i denna ansökan. Kapacitetsutveckling av dessa utgör en viktig del av insatsen.

Diakonias övergripande mål är att förändra de politiska, ekonomiska, sociala och kulturella strukturer som skapar fattigdom, förtryck och våld. Diakonia stöder en bred krets av civila samhällesorganisationer med utgångspunkt från sin förändringsteori som fokuserar på medvetenhet och kunskap om rättigheter, mobilisering samt kollektivt agerande och påverkansarbete.

Förväntade resultat:
Förväntade resultat specificeras per land/regionalt program. Det är stora skillnader mellan programmen i hur resultaten utformas. Sida bedömer att de förväntade resultaten i flera fall är på en väl övergripande nivå, men de indikatorer som anges konkretiserar dem och gör dem uppföljningsbara. Exempel på förväntade resultat, ett från varje region, inom några vanliga tematiska områden är:

The project is aligned with the government's Poverty Reduction Strategy, National Ebola Recovery Plan, and the United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) for Guinea. A budget revision in 2016 (i) realigns the number of school feeding beneficiaries to the current environment; (ii) moves nutrition activities toward a more preventative approach; (iii) strengthens synergies between school feeding, community engagement and agricultural development; and (iv) integrates a caseload of 24,534 Ebola-affected beneficiaries previously assisted through the Regional Emergency Operation 200761 (EMOP).

Under component 1 the school meals programme aims to i) increase attendance rates in primary school children; ii) reduce of drop-out rates amongst primary school children, particularly girls; and iii) enhance government capacity to monitor and manage school feeding activities. School feeding is part of broader school health and nutrition programmes that have proven to provide a vital safety net for children in terms of nutrition, education and health.

Component 2 aims to improve the nutritional situation of targeted categories of vulnerable people, including selected children aged 6 to 59 months, selected pregnant and lactating women and assisted malnourished clients on anti-retroviral treatment (ART) or TB clients. WFP's approach to nutrition takes into consideration the results of the SMART and EFSA assessments that took place in 2015, which demonstrated that the nutritional status of already vulnerable groups is further exacerbated by factors such as infectious diseases, parasitic disorders and food insecurity, especially among children. WFP has also been working to provide food assistance to malnourished clients on ART and TB clients to improve treatment adherence and has continued to shape its nutrition assistance in such a way that it addresses acute and chronic under nutrition through both the treatment of Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM) and the prevention of acute malnutrition, micronutrient deficiencies and chronic malnutrition; as well as facilitating a coherent coordination of nutrition interventions that are in place, in part facilitated by the REACH and SUN.       

Through Component 3, WFP supports rural communities to boost agricultural production, helping to reduce their vulnerability. This activity supports mainly women farmers groups that specialize in vegetable gardens - to increase their production and supply school canteens supported by WFP with fresh vegetables (including spinach, green pepper, okra, onions, etc). Under component 1, WFP is also supporting local rice farmers by purchasing locally produced parboiled rice from them for the school meals activity.","False","False","Transaction",,"XM-DAC-41140-200326",966,"wfp"

During the 1990s, most Latin American countries adopted ambitious constitutional reforms recognizing the right to participation. Examples include: 
-consumer rights in public utilities regulation
-victims' rights to participate in prosecuting grave human rights violations
-the right to be consulted about large development projects.

The new participation rights are intended to help guarantee that individuals can have a say in processes of government decision- and policy-making. More generally, governments adopted those rights to improve accountability, increase local ownership of decision-making, and to increase their democratic legitimacy.

On the surface, many of these new participation arrangements look the same, often reflecting international best practices. Existing academic and policy research has focused on the institutions, or only analyzes participation rights in terms of whether a legal text or court judgement guarantees those rights.

In reality, very little is known about what impact expanded participation rights have had on decision-making, accountability, and development processes at the local level. The impacts may be positive or negative, intended or unintended.

Equally unclear is how citizens, individually or through civil society, can make effective use of the new arrangements. There are other questions, too. For example, have the reforms lived up to the goals of helping enhance public officials' legitimacy and accountability? Have they improved public responses to local-level challenges? This research seeks to fill important knowledge gaps on participation and develop a better understanding of participation in Latin America. 

Partner institutions in Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador, Colombia, and Peru will conduct a case study through their legal clinics. The research will combine legal and qualitative research methodologies, while engaging civil society groups. Researchers will study those groups' ongoing efforts to enhance participation. 

The research aims to generate actionable policy proposals to improve how participation rights reforms are implemented in each of the five countries. The recommendations will aim to support democratic transformations in the region, while feeding into larger international legal and policy debates on participation.","False","False","Transaction",,"XM-DAC-301-2-107814-005",301,"CA"

The Productive Assets and Livelihoods component contributed to improve household food security and resilience. It provided seasonal employment and livelihood training that enabled rehabilitation of rural roads, irrigation channels and other community assets and acted as a safety net for rural households with low income. Through these projects, people were assisted in applying available resources in their community in more sustainable ways.

The Education Support component aligned with the government's School Sector Reform Programme, intended to provide children with an education of better quality. WFP provided school meals to pre-primary and primary schoolchildren with the purpose of keeping children in school and encouraging more children to be enrolled, both girls and boys, and improving their attendance. WFP also built school infrastructure, rehabilitated kitchens, latrines, and water stations. WFP distributed non-food items, particularly energy-saving stoves, cooking utensils and school furniture among others in an effort to assist the government in developing child-friendly schools that attract more children to study in a better learning environment. WFP worked in partnership with the Food for Education Project (FFEP) under the Ministry of Education.

The Nutrition Component provided support to the Ministry of Health and Population to prevent chronic malnutrition among pregnant and lactating women (PLW) and children aged 6 to 23 months through the Mother and Child Health and Nutrition (MCHN) programme. The specialised nutritious food ""Super Cereal"" was given to PLW and children, complemented with key messages on health, nutrition and hygiene habits. WFP also planned to support the government to treat moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) in children aged 6 to 59 months, in partnership with UNICEF under the Integrated Management of Moderate Acute Malnutrition (IMAM) programme. In addition, WFP supported a study on low birth weight in two districts which was concluded in 2015.

Capacity Development was provided across the three components, to strengthen the government's ability to implement these and similar programmes. In particular, WFP provided technical assistance and supported the institutionalisation of a national monitoring system known as the Nepal Food Security Monitoring System (NeKSAP) into government structures at the national and sub-national level. A key WFP contribution to augment the government's logistics and telecommunications capabilities was the humanitarian staging area (HSA) constructed under the Emergency Preparedness and Response (EPR) project with resources provided through a Trust Fund, in the Tribhuvan International Airport.

The operation contributed to the advancement of a regional approach to food insecurity and disaster management in Central America, as WFP's emergency responses were aligned with the governments-endorsed Regional Disaster Reduction Plan (2006-2015). Food security and nutrition activities were also compatible with the Second Regional Programme for Food and Nutrition Security in Central America.

In 2013, the PRRO responded to the effects of floods, earthquake, the prolonged impact of the 2012 drought, and the coffee rust infestation in the CA4. PRRO activities aligned with national priorities and supported the capacity development of government counterparts. CA4 activities focused on immediate relief through general food distributions (GFD) and also supplementary feeding in Guatemala to populations affected by shocks, in line with WFP Strategic Objective 1. In addition, early recovery activities in the form of food assistance for assets (FFA) and food assistance for training (FFT) interventions were implemented, in line with WFP Strategic Objective 3.

Through budget revision 2, processed in 2012, the project was extended for the four countries to December 2013 and assistance was scaled up in Guatemala and El Salvador in view of the deteriorating food security and livelihoods situation for communities severely affected by successive shocks (drought in 2012 and tropical depression (TD-12E) in 2011). Honduras and Nicaragua also maintained needs. In 2013, budget revision 3 increased response further in Guatemala to support the government in mitigating the effects of the coffee rust.

Beneficiaries targeted in 2013 included vulnerable families affected by earthquake (Guatemala), drought (Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador), floods (Guatemala, Nicaragua) and the coffee rust infestation in all four countries. Emergency Food Security Assessments (EFSAs) or government assessment tools were used to target beneficiaries and participatory community-based planning was utilized to identify and implement appropriate activities.","False","False","Budget",2,"XM-DAC-41140-200043-HN",966,"wfp"

Despite increased openness to evidence-based policymaking, local funding for Latin American policy research institutions is extremely limited and often partisan. Except in Peru (and universities in general), policy research organizations are relatively young and face challenges common to newly established institutions anywhere: difficulties in establishing a focused research agenda, problems in attracting and retaining staff and governance issues.

This grant will strengthen the ability of the 12 selected research institutions to provide, disseminate and communicate high-quality research. This will be achieved through measures aimed at enhancing the ability of staff to conduct sound research, improving organizational governance, and communicating with policymakers. Particular effort will be made to enable grantees to mobilize other sources of funding, so that none become dependent on the Think Tank Initiative over the long term. The project will also support a platform for grantee networking both within the Initiative and with a wider network of institutions engaged in policy-related research.

The government made the request to UNHCR who then passed it on to WFP in line with the corporate UNHCR-WFP Joint Memorandum of Understanding of 2011. 

The specific objectives of the EMOP were to stabilize acute malnutrition among children under five and improve food consumption in the refugee and host populations; and to stabilize the enrolment of girls and boys at high risk of dropping out from targeted primary schools. The EMOP activities contributed to WFP's Strategic Objective 1 ('to save lives and protect livelihoods in emergencies'). 

Despite resolution of the political problem and relative improvement in security in Cote d'Ivoire, many refugees still remain in Liberia. Around 169,000 Ivorian refugees have returned to Cote d'Ivoire from Liberia since June 2011, mostly from Nimba County. However, refugees residing in Grand Gedeh, Maryland and River Gee counties are predominantly of the Krumen and Guere ethnic groups. They originate from areas that supported the former President Laurent Gbagbo. Their areas also experienced deterioration in security in mid-2012. Due to the fragile security situation persisting in their areas of origin, and possibly other factors as well, their return has been slow.

During loan preparation in late 2008 and early 2009, Thailand became one of the countries in Asia most affected by the global financial crisis making more urgent the need for resources. Around this time, the political climate also deteriorated significantly. The loan was negotiated in May 2009, but the government did not submit it to Parliament as the political situation did not allow parliamentary discussion as required by the Constitution. The economy began to recover in late 2009, and there has been a period of relative political calm since June 2010. As a result, the government initiated the process for parliamentary discussion of the loan, Parliament approved the loan in August, and the Government has now requested the Bank for final approval. The delay in Parliamentary approval meant a relatively long gap between negotiations and final board consideration. During this period, the government continued to make significant progress in implementation of the forward-looking reform program discussed during negotiations, in addition to the standard consideration of implementation of the prior actions.","False","False","Transaction",,"44000-P114154",905,"ida"

About CARIAA
The Collaborative Adaptation Research Initiative in Africa and Asia (CARIAA) aims to help build the resilience of poor people to climate change by supporting a network of consortia to conduct high-calibre research and policy engagement in hot spots in Africa and Asia. It is jointly funded by the UK's Department for International Development (DFID) and Canada's International Development Research Centre (IDRC).

Research consortia in Ghana
CARIAA supports four research consortia. Two of them work extensively in Ghana under the leadership of the University of Ghana: Adaptation at Scale in Semi-Arid Regions (ASSAR) and Deltas, Climate Change, Migration and Adaptation (DECCMA).

Collaboration and co-production activities within and between consortia are critical to CARIAA's success. Another key to success is to enable partners to act on emerging research or engagement opportunities that could not have been anticipated at the program's outset.

To address both of these needs, the CARIAA team at IDRC allocated part of the program's resources to an Opportunities and Synergies Fund (OSF). 

Support for climate change projects
The CARIAA Ghana Country Engagement Group (Ghana-CEG), formed by DECCMA and ASSAR, is undertaking the project, Promoting Research into Use through Networking and Engagement (PRUNE). Given that there are a number of climate change adaptation efforts  being carried out across various sectors in Ghana and the Volta Basin, it is important to have a dedicated resource that can coordinate outcomes of climate change research, policy formulation processes, and other related activities. This will help maintain a presence, build on previous discussions, provide feedback, and manage multiple project outcomes.

This project will hire a dedicated person (PRUNE Country Engagement Officer) to attend climate change and adaptation events in Ghana, synthetize information and outcomes, explore the connections between those events and CARIAA, and inform DECCMA and ASSAR about engagement opportunities at the policy and practice levels.

The PRUNE officer will
-refine 12-month work plans for the Ghana-CEG 
-establish a PRUNE database of communication activities and information about the initiatives
-prepare monthly reports on activities and stakeholder meetings
-submit an end-of-project report and recommendations

It will enable them to provide more objective, high-quality research that both informs and influences policy.

Local experts, better results
Among the key international development lessons learned, one in particular stands out. Public policies work best when local actors design and implement them. Without locally generated data and analysis, well-intentioned programs rarely respond to realities on the ground. Local experts are also needed to monitor implementation. Otherwise, the most thoughtfully designed projects may lose momentum or even collapse over the longer term. 

More and more, international and domestic donors recognize that local ownership is critical to successful development interventions. However, they often fail to invest in those national organizations that can do the ongoing research and analysis needed to effect improvements over time.

In light of this situation, this project provides a basis to implement the second phase of the Think Tank Initiative (TTI).

TTI is a multi-funder program dedicated to strengthening independent policy research institutions, or think tanks, in developing countries. The program aims to enhance their ability to provide sound research that informs and influences policy.

Fase III",122,12220,,"""Este proyecto tiene como propósito la mejora de la atención primaria en salud y el acceso y uso apropiado de medicamentos esenciales en 17 comunidades rurales de los municipios de Retalhuleu y Champerico en la costa sur de Guatemala. Por un lado la intervención se centra en la mejora de la calidad de los servicios de salud en las comunidades donde existe ya una cobertura mínima, y por otro la crea en aquellas comunidades en las que no existe ningún tipo de cobertura. Para ello se llevarán a cabo coordinaciones con otras organizaciones e instituciones que están presentes en la zona de intervención, así como con los distritos de salud del ministerio de salud pública y su dirección de área. El área de intervención lo comprenden 17 comunidades del Departamento de Retalhuleu, tres de ellas (San Juan Húmedo, Santa Inés y Las Victorias El Salto) en el municipio de Retalhuleu y catorce (Finca Nuevo Montecristo, Victorias III, Comunidad Andrés Girón La Verde, Finca María del Mar, Santa Cruz Cajolá, San Miguel las Pilas, Barrio La Esperanza, Barrio El Palmo, Nueva Gomera, El Triunfo, Nueva Cajolá, Aldea El Río y Cuchuapam) en el municipio de Champerico. El universo de beneficiarios/as son 12.903 personas (6.343 mujeres y 6.560 hombres), de las cuales 4.119 se beneficiarían directamente de la gestión del presente proyecto. Los principales componentes del proyecto son: -Fortalecimiento de servicios básicos de salud, con el remozamiento de dos puestos de salud de las comunidades Aztlan y Nueva Cajola y el equipamiento del puesto de salud de la comunidad Olga María Cuchuapan en el municipio de Champerico, Retalhuleu. -Implementación de un sistema de abastecimiento y regulación de medicamentos esenciales para la atención en salud comunitaria en los municipios de Retalhuleu y Champerico. -Fortalecimiento y promoción de la medicina natural a partir de la capacitación de 34 Promotores/as de salud, en la temática de la medicina natural y la implementación de un sistema de cultivo a nivel local para la siembra y procesamiento de plantas medicinales con productores individuales y organizados de Programas Comunitarios de Salud en 17 comunidades pertenecientes a los municipios de Retalhuleu y Champerico. -Mejora de la capacidad técnica de 34 promotores/as de salud y 34 terapeutas tradicionales sobre el uso y manejo racional de los medicamentos esenciales y atención primaria en 17 comunidades pertenecientes a los municipios de Retalhuleu y Champerico.

However, organic farming can do little to improve food security and livelihoods unless ecological, social and economic factors are taken into consideration.

This project - supported by the Canadian International Food Security Research Fund (CIFSRF), a joint program of IDRC and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) - will enable researchers to examine intensive organic smallholder farming systems in two regions of the Peruvian Andes known for their biodiversity and active farmers' associations.

Researchers will endeavor to increase farm productivity, by enhancing ecological cycles, improving seed through participatory plant breeding and valorizing indigenous crops. They will also look at social processes such as traditional knowledge, innovation, organizational links, policy and advocacy. Finally the project will include an economic component, dealing with livelihood dynamics, guarantee systems and access to markets for organic produce in the region.

TEKST :

 

1. Van 5 tot 7 november organiseerde PARIS21 in Parijs een technisch seminarie alsmede een Steering committee.  Het PARIS21-verslag dat vorige week binnenkwam bevindt zich in bijlage.  Onderstaand kort verslag komt enkel terug op de voor België belangrijke hoofdpunten.

 

2. Het seminarie van 5 november betrof praktische voorbeelden van statistische kennisopbouw in ontwikkelingslanden.  Heel wat ontwikkelingslanden waren zelf vertegenwoordigd op de vergadering om uitleg te geven over de uitbouw van hun nationaal statistisch systeem.  

 

De discussie-onderwerpen betroffen:  de satelietprogramma's van PARIS21, het Partner Report on Support to Statistics (PRESS), het Bulletin Board systeem van de Wereldbank en de rol van donoren in de statistische werking in ontwikkelingslanden.

 

De werkgroep PRESS stelde de laatste draftversie voor van zijn rapport over de statistische kennisopbouw in de ontwikkelingslanden.  BE merkte onder andere op dat het rapport teveel gericht is op de activteiten van de donoren en te weinig op een analyse van de eigen noden en budgetaire inspanningen vanwege de ontwikkelingslanden.

 

3.   Tijdens de voorbije jaren heeft België een aanzienlijke financiële bijdrage geleverd aan PARIS21. De beslissing over die bijdrage werd genomen in 2004 en had als reden het belang van de statistische kennisopbouw in de ontwikkelingslanden.   In 2005 bedroeg de Belgische bijdrage 400.000 EUR, in 2006 eveneens 400.000 EUR en in 2007 200.000 EUR.   België was daardoor de vijfde grootste donor (6,33%).  Alleen de Wereldbank (25%), UK (25%), Frankrijk (9%) en Nederland (6,5%) deden beter.  België kreeg dan ook een speciaal woord van dank tijdens de vergadering.

 

Voor het PWB 2009-2010 levert België nogmaals een bijdrage van 200.000 EUR.  Aangezien er nog vastleggings- en ordonnanceringskredieten beschikbaar waren, werd die bijdrage reeds vastgelegd en betaald eind 2008.

 

4. De veelzijdige activiteiten in verband met statistische kennisopbouw van de ontwikkelingslanden kwamen aan bod.  Daarbij staat het opzetten van National Strategies for the development of Statistics (NSDS) centraal en dat in samenwerking met de Wereldbank.   Andere programma's werden besproken:  IHS (International Household Survey Network), ADP (Accelerated data program), SRF (Statistics for Result facility), de landbouwstatistieken (Eurostat), het OESO project over ""progress of societies"", een statistische reflectiegroep over fragiele Staten en het  (VSS) Virtual Statistical System.

 

5. Op deze vergadering bleek nogmaals de sterke coordinerende en centrale rol die PARIS21 speelt voor alle actoren van statistische kennisopbouw.   Vooral de Wereldbank, Eurostat, de UN en de regionale ontwikkelingsbanken zijn de grote spelers.   Bij de bilaterale donoren zijn vooral VK, NL, CA, FR, BE, NO actief.   Op deze vergadering waren veel vertegenwoordigers uit ontwikkelingslanden (zuid-Afrika, Ghana, Afghanistan, Soudan, Kameroen, Ethiopië, Senegal).

 

6. De volgende vergadering van het Steering Committe van PARIS21 werd voorzien op 4-5 juni 2009 in Parijs.  Tijdens de African Statistics days van eind november 2009 wordt een vergadering van PARIS21 gepland (16-18 november) in Dakar, back to back met het ""African Symposium on Statistical Development (SSD)"".

WFP provided food assistance to newly-arrived Colombian refugees and asylum seekers to ensure that their immediate food needs were met. Additionally, recovery-related actions assisting both Colombian refugees and Ecuadorian host communities were implemented in areas where integration remains difficult. The operation paid particular attention to the needs of women by promoting gender equality and women's empowerment, and to protection issues by implementing actions to reduce tensions among all vulnerable groups.

In all activities, WFP's main objective is to increase diet diversity and change unhealthy eating habits through improved awareness and understanding of what constitutes good nutrition, by conditioning food assistance to the attendance of trainings and limiting the redemption of vouchers to healthy and nutritious products. The project's recovery component included support to school-based activities, trainings on production and marketing of nutritious foods, as well as on watersheds protection, under the food assistance-for-assets modality. Furthermore, local production was promoted by linking small-scale farmers' organizations to school-centered activities and to food assistance for refugees, and by strengthening capacities of farmers and local governments in supply chain management, including food quality control, production and marketing.

Sida konstaterar att kvinnors rättigheter till mark och egendom är centrala för stärkning av kvinnors ekonomiska egenmakt, eftersom mark ofta är en förutsättning för produktion av livsmedel och annan inkomstbringande verksamhet. Markrättigheter kan också användas som säkerhet för banklån, och utgör en investering för framtiden. Likaså är marken ofta en viktig del av den kulturella identiteten, en faktor i politisk makt och politiskt deltagande. Kvinnors markägande kan på många sätt stärka deras kapacitet, vidga deras förhandlingsutrymme och minska deras utsatthet. Markägande stärker också kvinnors sociala ställning och innebär därmed en form av skydd mot våld i nära relationer. Slutligen är kvinnors rättigheter till mark en fråga om mänskliga rättigheter. Sida gör bedömningen att den föreslagna insatsen är mycket relevant inom svenskt utvecklingssamarbete särskilt genom att den är väl kopplad till regeringens prioriteringar inom jämställdhet samt inom demokrati och mänskliga rättigheter.

Sidas internationella kapacitetsutvecklingsprogram (ITP) syftar till att vara ett strategiskt komplement till exempelvis bilaterala insatser. Genom att särskilt använda Sveriges komparativa fördelar ska stöd ges till efterfrågad kapacitetsstärkning av nyckelaktörer som andra strategier har svårt att erbjuda.

Sida bedömer att ITP är en lämplig samarbetsform för att svara på det identifierade behovet. Ett ITP är en insats som i sin helhet är utformad så att man återkommande under 5 år kompetensutvecklar personal från relvanta organisationer och institutioner inom respektive område där kunskapsöverförande i schemalagda undervisningsdelar varvas med mentorskap för deltagarnas egna förändringsprojekt som är en del av den egna organisationens verksamhetsplan.

Lantmäteriet har inkommit med ett förslag för genomförande av en kapacitetsutvecklingsinsats som följer ramarna för ett ITP genom att sammanföra strategiskt rekryterade deltagare i en serie liknande programomgångar (som varar ca 16 månader med schemalagd utbildning i Sverige och i regionen, mentorstöd i individuella eller gemensamma förändringsarbeten samt regionala workshops) med ca 25 deltagare från ett begränsat antal (ca fem per programserie) samarbetsländer. Deltagarna förväntas efter avslutad programomgång ha ökade kunskaper, verktyg och kontaktytor för att driva effektiva förändringsprocesser inom sina respektive organisationer och institutioner. Varje enskild programomgång utgör ett steg på vägen mot insatsmålet (och i förlängningen utvecklingsmålet) och varje deltagare i programmet förväntas genom sitt förändringsarbete bidra till att stärka sin organisations förutsättningar i förhållande till de konkreta utmaningar, problem eller svårigheter som landet och/eller organisationen står inför. Deltagarna från de olika programomgångarna ska samverka med varandra och ges förutsättning att bygga uthålliga nätverk sinsemellan. Tanken är att programomgångarna ska bygga på varandra där varje deltagande organisations förändringsprojekt är ett led i en förändringsprocess som ska leda till att stärka den institutionella kapaciteten inom sektorn i länderna. Genomförandet av de olika programomgångarna kommer att föregås av en inledande fas (Inception Phase) under 2016 där Lantmäteriet bl. a. kommer att identifiera tilltänkta deltagarorganisationer och göra en fördjupad behovsanalys.

I ansökan för 2015 tillkommer Turkiet och Somalia som projektländer. Namibia utökas från ett projektland till ett programland. Det finns även två tematiska program: Ett Särskilt program och Sociala Trygghetssystem. I ansökan ingår även ett Kvalitetssäkringsprogram med 16 projekt för metodutveckling av OPCs system för planering, uppföljning och utvärdering. Ansökan är skriven i enlighet med riktlinjerna för stöd under Strategin för stöd genom det civila samhället. Sida bedömer ansökan som komplett och relevant. 

OPC får även stöd från andra delar av Sida för sin verksamhet, men det är inte medel som stödjer detta ramprogram. Dessa medel var för verksamhetsår 2014 ca 56,3 MSEK sammanlagt. 
(Kommunikation: 2,4 MSEK, Partianknutet stöd (PAO): 22,3 MSEK, Västra Balkan:18,0 MSEK, Egypten: 9, 0 MSEK samt Burma: 4, 7 MSEK) Samtliga dessa program förväntas att fortsätta under 2015, men alla är inte beslutade av Sidas andra enheter/ambassader ännu.

OPC har för 2015 inkommit med en ansökan om rambidrag på sammanlagt 80 174 941 SEK. (Belopp inkluderar verksamhetskostnader, vidareförmedlingskostnad och administrationsstöd.) Budgeten för verksamheten per år ligger på en högre nivå än för programperioden 2012-2014 och innebär en ökning av ansökta medel med ca 15 %. Ökningen är relativt jämnt spridd över samtliga program och projekt. OPC har i sin ansökan inte motiverat ökningen, men när Sida ställer frågan svarar OPC att ökningen beror på att OPC har flyttat fram balanser mellan åren (i den nu pågående perioden 2012-2014), och även startat nya projekt under 2014 som OPC vill fortsätta med under 2015. Avsikten är också att dessa projekt ska fortgå under den nästkommande längre perioden från 2016 och framåt. OPC svarar vidare att de avser utöka sitt kansli med tre nya tjänster, (1 handläggare, 1 controller och 1 metodsamordnare) i syfte att bl.a kunna bibehålla kvalitén i programmen då flera samarbeten nu har initierats med små, resurssvaga, organisationer som kräver mera tid och stöd. OPC intensifierar också sitt metodarbete i syfte att bidra till det kontinuerliga lärandet och utvecklingen av verksamheten. OPC vill framöver stödja organisationer i projektländerna Somalia och Turkiet, vilket kräver särskild handläggarkompetens.

EHNRI will continue to support national laboratory systems with particular focus on standardization of laboratory services, regional capacity development, harmonization and standardization of equipment procurement, support the National and Regional Quality Assessment Programs, equipment maintenance services, specimen referral and laboratory workforce development. EHNRI provides guidance for establishment and implementation of laboratory accreditation systems. EHNRI will play a national leadership role in improving TB laboratory diagnosis. 

Strategic information is crucial as there is a need to generate accurate and timely estimates of trends in prevalence, incidence, most at-risk populations (MARPS), and the impact of interventions. EHNRI will lead the national effort to conduct ANC-based HIV surveillance, TB/HIV, STI syndromic and etiologic surveillance, and surveillance of HIV cases among MARPS. EHNRI will conduct evaluation of better diagnostic technologies including point-of-care tests. 

EHNRI works in collaboration with partners and Regional Health Bureaus to effectively manage the program. This is the second year of the current cooperative agreement and hence, COP 2013 and reprogrammed funds are the only available pipeline funds.

A comprehensive school survey revealed clear disparities between rural and urban schools. Across the country, schools in rural communities that are remote from provincial and district centers are disadvantaged in almost every aspect in relation to the quality of school facilities, as well as availability of learning and teaching inputs. 

About 80% of Uzbekistan s 9,773 basic schools are located in rural areas. The vast majority of rural basic schools are considered in very poor condition requiring emergency repairs and major rehabilitation works. Common defects were leaking roofs, water infiltration to the building structures, damaged windows and doors, defective floors, malfunctioning sanitary and plumbing facilities, broken heating systems, and leaking water supply system. Most classroom furniture is also in very poor condition. About 70% of schools had no science laboratory equipment and lack modern teaching aids and learning materials. 

Teaching techniques and subject knowledge of many teachers particularly in rural schools are inadequate and outdated. Most teachers still apply traditional teaching methods, devoting attention mostly to narrow subject knowledge, requiring students to memorize and repeat notions and definitions. Critical thinking, problem solving, communication skills and teamwork do not receive sufficient attention. Although training programs for teachers have been revised gradually, the current in-service training system needs to become more flexible to adjust to specific subject related requirements of teachers in rural school, who work under difficult circumstances. 

To address the issues in rural schools, the Government launched the National Program for Basic Education Development (NPBED) 2004 2009, which aims to strengthen basic education to meet international standards and remove disparities. The investment costs of the NPBED, are estimated at $1.2 billion, to be financed by a combination of 75% budget financing, 20% foreign investment financing, and 5% local donor contributions. Major investments include school construction and rehabilitation, and significant salary increases for teachers.

It is proposed that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) intervention will complement Government s NPBED and focus on improving the relevance and quality of basic education in rural areas. Other ongoing ADB interventions in the education sector provide assistance in addressing issues related to (i) policy planning, governance and management; (ii) curriculum modernization and textbook development; and (iii) improving teaching and learning through information and communication technology (ICT).

The impact of the Project will be improved opportunities for graduates from rural basic schools to progress to higher levels of education. The Project outcome will be improved equitable access to and enhanced quality and relevance of basic education in rural areas in three project oblasts. The expected outcome will be achieved by (i) upgrading of school facilities, (ii) enhancing the capacity of teacher training institutions and raion education departments to strengthen teaching in rural schools, and (iii) increasing community participation in school life.","False","False","Budget",1,"46004-40049-013-LN2380",915,"asdb"

Why the Himalayan region is important
The region, stretching from central Afghanistan to northern Pakistan, is one of the world's most dynamic, diverse, and complex mountain and floodplain systems. It provides water resources and other ecosystem services to more than 210 million people in the mountains and 1.3 billion people living downstream. 

How this research will support adaptation
Socio-economic changes, combined with climate change impacts, may significantly affect the livelihoods of everyone in the region. To help the people of Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, and Nepal adapt, this project will develop robust evidence to inform climate change adaptation policies and practices. 

Researchers will focus on the Indus, Ganges, and Brahmaputra river basins. They will compare research and pilot results analyzing adaptation interventions at a variety of sites. The research sites will represent a range of climatic and hydrological conditions and socio-economic contexts. Stakeholders will be actively involved in the process.

Expected research results
A research consortium with a reputation for excellence will lead the project, which is expected to:
-generate scientific knowledge on climate change impacts, vulnerability drivers, and adaptation policies and practices; 
-promote decision-makers' use of knowledge and adaptation practices at various scales to reduce vulnerabilities and build livelihood resilience; and 
-strengthen interdisciplinary expertise in climate change adaptation and resilience research. 

These outcomes will allow governments to improve their adaptation policies and practices. They will also help ensure that funds can be mobilized for sustainable adaptation strategies.","False","False","Transaction",,"XM-DAC-301-2-107641-001",301,"CA"

The project team will scale up successful initiatives that use locally grown crops for ready-to-use therapeutic foods and fortified complementary foods.

Nourishment and better health
Therapeutic foods are energy-dense, micronutrient-enriched pastes or bars designed to provide high-density nutrition for severely undernourished children. Complementary foods are designed for the diets of all children between the ages of 6 to 24 months.

Researchers from the National Institute of Nutrition, Vietnam and Canada's Ryerson University will use scaling up strategies to
-procure crops directly from women farmers in rural Vietnam 
-establish decentralized production of fortified complementary foods and therapeutic foods in small-scale food processing facilities
-distribute the products using a supply chain that includes public health providers (such as the Ministry of Health and international organizations) and commercial channels

The project aims to build on the experience of NINFoods, a business-oriented subsidiary of the National Institute of Nutrition. The company successfully standardized the production of a high-energy nutritious bar for integrated management of acute malnutrition. 

Better nutrition by region
Initially, the project team will establish and scale up production of region-specific fortified complementary foods by creating decentralized food production facilities in three rural regions of northern Vietnam. They will then produce ready-to-use therapeutic foods. The Vietnam Women's Union will act as the main liaison with the women farmers who will receive training on agro-ecological practices, post-harvest handling, food safety, and how to form producer associations.

By the end of 28 months, the complementary and therapeutic foods from the decentralized facilities will benefit an estimated 15,000 malnourished children. Three nutrition-counselling centres established through the project will serve as product distribution points. Together, they will help more than 1,500 mothers annually with counselling on child feeding practices.

We Effect har inkommit med en ansökan om rambidrag för 2017 på sammanlagt SEK 188 033 400 för en ettårig förlängning av det program som genomförs under ramanslaget 2014-2016. Sida har därför beslutat att bereda insatsen som ett kompletterande insatsbeslut. Sida bedömer att ansökan är relevant under den nya strategin för stöd genom Svenska organisationer i det civila samhället (CSO-strategin) 2016-2022 och beslutar om ett bidrag om 180 000 000 SEK. Denna beredning har genomförts i samarbete mellan handläggare Eva-Lotta Gustafsson och USAID:s sekondering till Sida Joshua Haynes.

Ansökande organisation: 

We Effect är en ideell, partipolitiskt och religiöst obunden organisation vars syfte är att stärka medlemsbaserade och demokratiska organisationers förmåga att göra det möjligt för fattiga kvinnor och män att förbättra sina levnadsvillkor, försvara sina rättigheter och bidra till ett rättvist samhälle. We Effect bildades 1958 och har varit ramorganisation sedan 1978 under namnet Kooperation Utan Gränser. Organisationen är en demokratiskt strukturerad förening och bakom We Effect står ett sextiotal medlemsorganisationer från den svenska konsument- och producentkooperationen. We Effect är en väletablerad organisation i det svenska samhället, med ett öppet och demokratiskt arbetssätt - och med en stark internationell förankring.

We Effects vision är en hållbar och rättvis värld fri från fattigdom och organisationen arbetar inom landsbygdsutveckling och bostäder, inkluderat rätten till mark, jämställdhet och finansiella tjänster. Ansökan omfattar 17 program på regional eller landnivå och ett globalt program som totalt består av 160 projekt i 24 länder. 

Sida beslutade 2014 att förnya We Effects status som ramorganisation. 

Ansökan:

Ansökan bygger på We Effects prioriteringar och följer logiskt på tidigare verksamhet. We Effects ramansökan för 2017 är en fortsättning på det ramprogram som genomförs under pågående ramavtal 2014-2016.

Syftet med stödet är att stärka partnerorganisationen som sådan och att detta i sin tur ökar organisationens förmåga att å ena sidan påverka och kräva förändring på makronivå/strukturell nivå och, å andra sidan erbjuda medlemmarna efterfrågade tjänster. Enligt We Effects förändringsteori genomförs den huvudsakliga verksamheten av partnerorganisationerna. Inom programmen för landsbygdsutveckling stödjer We Effect bondeorganisationer i deras arbete med att öka sina medlemmars inkomster och tillgång till mat genom t.ex. jordbruksrådgivning, stärkt position på marknaden och hjälp med förhandlingar om priser. Organisationen förespråkar ett hållbart och klimatanpassat jordbruk och stödjer också lokala spar- och kreditföreningar som gör det möjligt för lantbrukare med små resurser att spara och låna pengar samt få tillgång till försäkringar. Inom bostadsprogrammen arbetar We Effect med lokala bostadskooperativ där medlemmarna tillsammans bygger sina bostäder. Kooperativen bedriver påverkansarbete för tillgång till bostadskrediter och säkrad rätt till mark att bygga på. Jämställdhet är ett prioriterat område för We Effects verksamhet. We Effect strävar efter att integrera jämställdhet i all verksamhet och organisationen stödjer partnerorganisationernas arbete med att stärka kvinnors rättigheter, bland annat genom kvinnligt ledarskap, en mer rättvis arbetsfördelning i jordbruket samt genom att försvara kvinnors rätt till mark. 

Målgruppen för We Effects utvecklingssamarbete är kvinnor och män som lever i fattigdom och som är medlemmar, eller potentiella medlemmar, i kooperativa organisationer, andra demokratiska föreningar eller informella grupper vilka arbetar för att uppnå gemensamma mål.

Förväntade resultat:

We Effects ansökan har resultatmatriser på land- och regional nivå, med indikatorer och utgångsvärden. På global nivå finns en resultatmatris men utan aggregerade utgångs- och målvärden. Ansökan har följande mål:

This included: 30,000 IDPs in South Sudan, 5,000 refugees in Ethiopia and up to 40,000 people who were expected to require assistance during the initial phase of the emergency but who had not yet been identified.

While these two economies have succeeded in reducing poverty and gaining influence in global affairs, both still experience high inequality, though with different patterns. 

In Brazil, inequality has dropped by 9% between 1993 and 2008, while in India,,  it increased by 16%. This reflects the different labour markets in both countries, which provide the main source of income for households.

This research project brings together The Centre for Analysis and Planning in São Paulo (CEBRAP) and the Institute for Human Development in Delhi who will develop comparable measures of inequality in wage income and examine contributing factors such as changes in supply and demand for workers and social factors such as gender, race, and caste.

The CP was approved by the Executive Board in 2012 and is in line with Strategic Objective 3 and 4 of the WFP Strategic Plan for 2014-2017. The overall objective of the CP is to strengthen local and national capacities in order to break the intergenerational cycle of hunger. Specifically, WFP aims to enhance food and nutrition security by improving education, nutrition and health throughout the life cycle; to strengthen communities' resilience by mitigating shocks and adapting to climate change; to link the demand of local food-based assistance programmes to small farmers, thereby transforming food and nutrition assistance into productive investments in local communities; and to strengthen government capacity to design, manage and implement tools, policies and programmes for assessing and reducing hunger.

The CP has three components:

1. A sustainable and productive school feeding programme, with the specific objectives of increasing primary school enrolment and ensuring completion; alleviating short-term hunger and preventing micronutrient deficiencies among schoolchildren; and providing technical assistance to connecting farmers to markets by the use of local food products for school feeding.

2. Support government nutrition programmes to prevent stunting and reduce low birth weight through the provision of nutrition education and complementary food distributions to pregnant and lactating women. (WFP Strategic Objective 4)

3. Livelihoods development and disaster risk reduction to strengthen communities' resilience. Conditional food assistance linked to asset creation activities will mitigate shocks, support adaptation to climate change and improve household food security. (WFP Strategic Objective 3)

All components include capacity development and augmentation activities to support the government in managing national food-based safety nets and to strengthen the implementation of food security and sovereignty policies. Components were built upon past cooperation, partnerships with United Nations agencies and NGOs in order to support government social policies and legal framework applying to nutrition, school feeding and local food production.","False","False","Transaction",,"XM-DAC-41140-200381",966,"wfp"

Tanzania is expected to feel the effects of the global economic crisis mostly through export channels (mainly tourism, regional manufacturing exports, cash crops, and natural resources) and lower capital flows from private and possibly official assistance. Because of the structure of its trade balance, which is heavily influenced by oil on the import side and gold on the export side, the net impact is likely to be lower in Tanzania than in other countries. The financial sector is mainly sound and not exposed to global toxic assets.

Specifically, it aims to add to the knowledge of how to improve livelihoods and reduce poverty in a sustainable way in rural communities. It will strive to:
- improve programming in rural development in Africa and Canada by obtaining new knowledge about integrated co-operative models in practice; 
- explore the added value of an integrated approach to co-operative development as a tool for rural development; and, 
- assess whether rural development through co-operatives works better when the co-operatives are integrated, and if so, under what conditions this integration works best.

The lead institution, the Canadian Co-operative Association (CCA), will partner with the Centre for the Study of Co-operatives at the University of Saskatchewan, Moshi University College of Co-operative and Business Studies (Tanzania), and the Department of Agricultural Economics and Agribusiness at Makerere University (Uganda).

CCA has supported the development of the Integrated Co-operative model. In this model, ""production, marketing support, and financial services are integrated, yet separate."" CCA is planning to scale up the model and support its application in new contexts. Working together within this model, co-operative members attain both individual and collective goals that increase food production, create linkages to larger markets and better prices, and provide access to affordable financial services. 

The research will help to assess the value of the integrated model, by comparing communities where it is in place to those where other models are used. It will examine comparable situations in Canada, Uganda, Tanzania, and Rwanda. Researchers will assess the nature of the enabling environment for the integrated model, and how the policy context can be influenced to support this approach. An enabling environment is a set of interrelated conditions, such as legal, economic, political, and cultural, that have an impact on the ability of development actors to engage in sustained activities.

The results will show whether the Integrated Co-operative Model brings added value to communities by helping them achieve development and poverty reduction goals (or in other, unanticipated ways). They will also lead to recommendations about the model's broader application. The results will be relevant to CCA, co-operative members, co-operatives, and other co-operative development practitioners. They will also inform understanding of co-operative integration both in Canada and in developing countries.","False","False","Transaction",,"XM-DAC-301-2-107107-001",301,"CA"

WFP's humanitarian assistance included the provision of food or cash-based transfers (CBT) to internally displaced persons (IDPs) and returnees affected by conflict, to people affected by economic stress or natural disasters, such as floods and landslides, as well as for the treatment of acutely malnourished children under five years of age and pregnant and lactating women (PLW). According to the Afghanistan National Nutrition Survey (NNS) 2013, 40.9 percent of children under five were chronically malnourished (stunted), 9.5 percent were acutely malnourished (wasted) and 24.6 percent underweight. 

The context of maternal and child nutrition status is characterised by a high prevalence of malnutrition, including micronutrient deficiencies, due to inadequate dietary intake, frequent infections and poor maternal outcomes. Maternal undernutrition is equally concerning with one-fifth of adolescent girls and women of reproductive age undernourished (low body mass index). Underweight women are more likely to give birth to low birthweight babies at higher risk of neonatal and infant death and stunted growth. The NNS 2013 showed that women and adolescent girls who had little or no formal education or came from impoverished households were more likely to be malnourished and deficient in essential micronutrients.

As part of its recovery strategy, WFP supported communities in their efforts to build productive assets that increase agricultural productivity and strengthen resilience to shocks. Additionally, WFP's recovery activities contributed to increased enrolment, attendance and learning capacity among primary and lower secondary school pupils through take-home rations, and among adults, particularly women, through vocational skills training activities.

Aligned with WFP Strategic Objectives 1, 2 and 4, the PRRO aimed to:

- respond to the food security and nutritional needs of IDPs and returnees affected by conflict, and people affected by natural disasters and economic stress (under Strategic Objective 1); 
- support the recovery of communities affected by shocks (under Strategic Objective 2); 
- treat moderately malnourished children under-5 and PLW (under Strategic Objective 4); 
- contribute to learning among primary and lower secondary school pupils and adults, particularly women (under Strategic Objective 4). 

Under capacity development, WFP's Purchase for Progress (P4P) initiative continued to procure locally produced high-energy biscuits (HEB) for emergency response, wheat grain from local small-holder farmer organizations and also to connect farmers with millers in order to create a sustainable institutional market for their surplus. This contributed to WFP's shift to more nutrition-sensitive entitlement baskets in mid-2015. WFP facilitated capacity development events for government staff, farmers and national counterparts. Training included major disaster response simulation exercises, with a focus on emergency preparedness and response capacity, food security analysis and disaster risk reduction (DRR).

Stockholm resilience Center SRC är ett tvärvetenskapligt forskningscenter vid Stockholms Universitet som bildades 2007 och arbetar utifrån olika discipliner kring gemensamma frågeställningar där fokus ligger på interaktioner, processer och mekanismer som präglar samspelet mellan samhället och ekosystemen. Ambitionen är att utveckla förståelse av komplexa socio-ekologiska system och bidra med nya insikter och redskap som krävs för att styra om samhällsutvecklingen i en hållbar riktning. SRC har byggt upp en gedigen kunskap inom resiliens och agerar rådgivare åt politiker och policyutvecklare på den internationella arenan.

GRP är ett globalt initiativ, med en budget på 150 MUSD, som nyligen initierats av Rockefeller Foundation, USAID och Sida för samarbete kring resiliens där fokus geografiskt ligger på Sahel, Afrikas Horn och Syd- och Sydostasien. Dessa områden är starkt utsatta för miljö och klimatförändringar och GRP har målsättningen att via olika samarbeten identifiera kunskapsluckor och kapacitetsbrist, kartlägga och lyfta fram tekniska innovationer och metoder som kan replikeras och gynna fattiga människor i dessa områden. GRP vill också verka katalytiskt genom olika nätverk och stärka allianser tvärsektoriellt för att möjliggöra kunskapsutbyte på regional nivå. Datainsamling på lokal nivå i fokusområdena kommer att bli en viktig del och olika innovativa finansieringsmekanismer såsom obligationer och försäkringar kopplade till garantier kommer också att uppmuntras. 

Sidas verksföreträdare inom miljö och klimat ingår i GPRs Senior Management Team och ansvarar därmed för högnivådialogen med GRP. Sida ämnar inom GRP driva fattigdomsperspektivet och rättighetsperspektivet samt säkerställa att jämställdhet integreras i all den verksamhet som ska bedrivas. Sida ämnar bidra med 75 MSEK per år under fem år till GRP. Bidraget kommer att bestå av ett direkt stöd till partnerskapet i form av utlysningar och kunskapsspridning samt ett indirekt stöd där Sida kan stödja olika områden och partners inom resiliensområdet. Stödet till GRAID på 107 MSEK 2015-2019 är en del av detta indirekta stöd och ska ses som ett stöd till operationaliseringen av GRP.","True","True","Budget",,"SE-0-SE-6-6105018001-GGG-41010",10,"SE"

The growth outlook for Tanzania continues to remain optimistic, although there are certain risks. The economy is estimated to grow by 6.8 percent in 2012, slightly lower than the previous year. The medium term growth outlook remains positive. Achieving a buoyant outlook is dependent on addressing infrastructure bottlenecks, structural reforms, and carrying out sound public finance policy and public financial management. However, this remains vulnerable to domestic and external shocks including the Euro zone debt crisis. The level of foreign aid is already projected to decline significantly in FY2012/13. Fiscal consolidation for the central government is on track and is in line with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) policy support instrument program. The budget framework for 2012/13 is expected to reduce the fiscal deficit to 5.5 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), closer to the level before the global financial crisis. The latest debt sustainability analysis (June 2012) shows that Tanzania's risk of debt stress remains low but is sensitive to borrowing terms and the government's fiscal position.

Its goal is to support policies and programs that can empower women to overcome barriers stemming from their dual roles as money-earners and primary care providers.

Even as more women enter the labour force, their unpaid domestic responsibilities have not diminished. In developing countries, women and girls regularly take on unpaid care work. This has important implications for their economic empowerment. It can 
- restrict their ability to participate in economic, social, and political activities
- limit their ability to seek employment 
- constrain their employment choices and options 

By quantifying time spent on care work and women's unpaid contribution to the economy, time-use surveys have helped us better understand the burden of care. However, there are knowledge gaps. We need a deeper understanding of the relationship between women's paid and unpaid care work, and how care is organized. 

This project will focus on India, Nepal, Rwanda, and Tanzania. Researchers will examine the links between women's economic empowerment, women's paid work, and their unpaid care responsibilities. The insights will encourage policies that consider care arrangements while also increasing women's participation in the labour force.

The research team will use the results to offer policy advice on how state and non-state women's economic empowerment policies and programs can integrate unpaid care work. The goal? To maximize knowledge and share solutions across families and generations.

This research is supported under the Growth and Economic Opportunities for Women (GrOW) program. GrOW is a five-year, multi-funder partnership of the United Kingdom's Department for International Development, The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, and IDRC.

In Haiti, illiteracy is common especially among women and it makes it very difficult for them to find employment and participate fully in the society. Young people often lack possibilities to study and get an occupation to employ and gain a living. Through the project, literacy training is offered to women and vocational training to young people. In addition, the project strengthens womenŽs network RENAFANM and its self-sufficiency so that it can serve as a way to women participate in the society and offer activities and services to young people and women.  During the project period, at least 720 Haitian young people participate in vocational training that helps them to find employment. The subjects are sewing, electricity and plumbing, construction and cooking. These have been identified by Renafanm to be the most useful in finding a job. The second result of the project is that at least 1200 women and men learn to read and write and increase their knowledge on reproductive health, cooperative systems and environmental issues.  ProjectŽs direct beneficiaries are the 720 young people who participate in vocational training and the 1200 women and men who learn to read and write. Indirectly, the project benefits all aproximately 8000 members of RENAFANM and their families.  The project is implemented by womensŽ network RENAFANM (Rezo Nasyonal Fanm) and a training and research center CPB (Centre Petión Bolívar).

One of the objectives of the CIFSRF is to ensure that the results generated by the research funded are used to inform food security policies, programs, and on-the-ground development activities. Partnership is also an important aspect of the CIFSRF. All the research projects funded are jointly conducted by Canadian and developing country-based organizations, such as academic institutions, private sector organizations, civil society organizations, or research institutions.

ANSÖKAN 
Olof Palmes Internationella Center (OPC) är en av Sidas ramorganisationer. OPC har ett pågående program 2012-2014 varpå denna ansökan i stort är en förlängning. Det övergripande målet är att ""Fattiga människors makt att påverka sina samhällen och sina egna liv stärks genom gemensamt agerande"". I gällande ansökan planerar OPC verksamhet i 11 länder. Av dessa är 7 programländer: Namibia, Sydafrika, Zimbabwe, Burma, Filippinerna, Bosnien-Hercegovina och Serbien. Det finns även 4 projektländer: Turkiet, Bolivia, Pakistan och Somalia. I ansökan för 2015 tillkommer Turkiet och Somalia som projektländer. Namibia utökas från ett projektland till ett programland. Det finns även två tematiska program: Ett Särskilt program och Sociala Trygghetssystem. I ansökan ingår även ett Kvalitetssäkringsprogram med 16 projekt för metodutveckling av OPCs system för planering, uppföljning och utvärdering. Ansökan är skriven i enlighet med riktlinjerna för stöd under Strategin för stöd genom det civila samhället. Sida bedömer ansökan som komplett och relevant. 

OPC får även stöd från andra delar av Sida för sin verksamhet, men det är inte medel som stödjer detta ramprogram. Dessa medel var för verksamhetsår 2014 ca 56,3 MSEK sammanlagt. 
(Kommunikation: 2,4 MSEK, Partianknutet stöd (PAO): 22,3 MSEK, Västra Balkan:18,0 MSEK, Egypten: 9, 0 MSEK samt Burma: 4, 7 MSEK) Samtliga dessa program förväntas att fortsätta under 2015, men alla är inte beslutade av Sidas andra enheter/ambassader ännu.

OPC har för 2015 inkommit med en ansökan om rambidrag på sammanlagt 80 174 941 SEK. (Belopp inkluderar verksamhetskostnader, vidareförmedlingskostnad och administrationsstöd.) Budgeten för verksamheten per år ligger på en högre nivå än för programperioden 2012-2014 och innebär en ökning av ansökta medel med ca 15 %. Ökningen är relativt jämnt spridd över samtliga program och projekt. OPC har i sin ansökan inte motiverat ökningen, men när Sida ställer frågan svarar OPC att ökningen beror på att OPC har flyttat fram balanser mellan åren (i den nu pågående perioden 2012-2014), och även startat nya projekt under 2014 som OPC vill fortsätta med under 2015. Avsikten är också att dessa projekt ska fortgå under den nästkommande längre perioden från 2016 och framåt. OPC svarar vidare att de avser utöka sitt kansli med tre nya tjänster, (1 handläggare, 1 controller och 1 metodsamordnare) i syfte att bl.a kunna bibehålla kvalitén i programmen då flera samarbeten nu har initierats med små, resurssvaga, organisationer som kräver mera tid och stöd. OPC intensifierar också sitt metodarbete i syfte att bidra till det kontinuerliga lärandet och utvecklingen av verksamheten. OPC vill framöver stödja organisationer i projektländerna Somalia och Turkiet, vilket kräver särskild handläggarkompetens.

About the Livestock Vaccine Innovation Fund
The LVIF is a partnership between the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Global Affairs Canada (formerly Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada), and the International Development Research Centre. It represents a joint investment of CA$57 million over five years to support the development, production, and commercialization of innovative vaccines against priority livestock diseases in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia.

More specifically, the LVIF will support innovation and research to increase the efficacy, marketability, and use of existing vaccines, develop new vaccines against priority livestock diseases, and build effective research and public-private partnerships to accelerate the registration, commercialization, and use of vaccines. 

The research will also lead to a better understanding of disease dynamics and their impact, as well as the issues that constrain poor farmers from using vaccines. By bringing together all stakeholders - from farmers to researchers, pharmaceutical companies, and regulators - the LVIF will foster a vibrant and sustainable livestock sector in the target regions.

Separate Project Approval Documents will authorize individual research projects and activities related to research uptake and scale up, program synthesis, and communication.

A second competitive call was launched in 2009, and a total of 12 institutions in seven countries were selected from Latin America.

Despite increased openness to evidence-based policymaking, local funding for Latin American policy research institutions is extremely limited and often partisan. Except in Peru (and universities in general), policy research organizations are relatively young and face challenges common to newly established institutions anywhere: difficulties in establishing a focused research agenda, problems in attracting and retaining staff and governance issues.

This grant will strengthen the ability of the 12 selected research institutions to provide, disseminate and communicate high-quality research. This will be achieved through measures aimed at enhancing the ability of staff to conduct sound research, improving organizational governance, and communicating with policymakers. Particular effort will be made to enable grantees to mobilize other sources of funding, so that none become dependent on the Think Tank Initiative over the long term. The project will also support a platform for grantee networking both within the Initiative and with a wider network of institutions engaged in policy-related research.

The Project implementation has improved considerably. With the first disbursement in early 2012, it has further picked up recently reaching nearly $1.3 million (about 10 percent) as of mid July 2012. In June 2012, with the help of the International Science and Commercialization Board (ISCB), an additional 11 groups were selected as a result of the second selection round making the total number of research projects equal to 21. The extension is necessary: (a) for the 21 groups of scientists to complete their 3-year research and development (R&amp;D) programs; (b) to complete the establishment of the Technology Commercialization Office (TCO) with the help of the international contractor selected through international competitive bidding; and (c) to launch and implement various activities to link Kazakh science to markets through the TCO.  A joint effort of MOES and Ministry of Finance (MOF) is expected to ensure timely approval of the feasibility study and inclusion of the project financing into the state budget for 2013. This is considered in light of the MOF request to extend the project closing date. This will be the first extension of the project.","False","False","Budget",1,"44000-P090695",905,"ida"

This component will support climate-resilient approaches that allows for the sustainable use of the natural resource base through agricultural and livestock production systems aiming to increase long term productivity and farm incomes in an environment marked by increased climate and, in particular, rainfall variability. Agrarian households in rural Rajasthan face tremendous challenges even with the existing levels of climate variability, let alone those that may come with future changes in climate. This is often referred to as an adaptation deficit. Thus the package of options in this component is based on a strategy that is robust under any future climate scenario and focuses on ways of overcoming this existing adaptation deficit as a necessary step towards longer term climate resilience. The second component is markets and value chains. The objective of this component is to enable farmers to engage in profitable market oriented production, that is sustainable, and to promote partnerships and market linkages with other value chain participants and agribusinesses.

The project is aligned with the government's Poverty Reduction Strategy, National Ebola Recovery Plan, and the United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) for Guinea. A budget revision in 2016 (i) realigns the number of school feeding beneficiaries to the current environment; (ii) moves nutrition activities toward a more preventative approach; (iii) strengthens synergies between school feeding, community engagement and agricultural development; and (iv) integrates a caseload of 24,534 Ebola-affected beneficiaries previously assisted through the Regional Emergency Operation 200761 (EMOP).

Under component 1 the school meals programme aims to i) increase attendance rates in primary school children; ii) reduce of drop-out rates amongst primary school children, particularly girls; and iii) enhance government capacity to monitor and manage school feeding activities. School feeding is part of broader school health and nutrition programmes that have proven to provide a vital safety net for children in terms of nutrition, education and health.

Component 2 aims to improve the nutritional situation of targeted categories of vulnerable people, including selected children aged 6 to 59 months, selected pregnant and lactating women and assisted malnourished clients on anti-retroviral treatment (ART) or TB clients. WFP's approach to nutrition takes into consideration the results of the SMART and EFSA assessments that took place in 2015, which demonstrated that the nutritional status of already vulnerable groups is further exacerbated by factors such as infectious diseases, parasitic disorders and food insecurity, especially among children. WFP has also been working to provide food assistance to malnourished clients on ART and TB clients to improve treatment adherence and has continued to shape its nutrition assistance in such a way that it addresses acute and chronic under nutrition through both the treatment of Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM) and the prevention of acute malnutrition, micronutrient deficiencies and chronic malnutrition; as well as facilitating a coherent coordination of nutrition interventions that are in place, in part facilitated by the REACH and SUN.       

Through Component 3, WFP supports rural communities to boost agricultural production, helping to reduce their vulnerability. This activity supports mainly women farmers groups that specialize in vegetable gardens - to increase their production and supply school canteens supported by WFP with fresh vegetables (including spinach, green pepper, okra, onions, etc). Under component 1, WFP is also supporting local rice farmers by purchasing locally produced parboiled rice from them for the school meals activity.","False","False","Transaction",,"XM-DAC-41140-200326",966,"wfp"

The LVIF is a partnership between the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Global Affairs Canada (formerly Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada), and the International Development Research Centre. It represents a joint investment of CA$57 million over five years to support the development, production, and commercialization of innovative vaccines against priority livestock diseases in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia.

More specifically, the LVIF will support innovation and research to increase the efficacy, marketability, and use of existing vaccines, develop new vaccines against priority livestock diseases, and build effective research and public-private partnerships to accelerate the registration, commercialization, and use of vaccines. 

The research will also lead to a better understanding of disease dynamics and their impact, as well as the issues that constrain poor farmers from using vaccines. By bringing together all stakeholders - from farmers to researchers, pharmaceutical companies, and regulators - the LVIF will foster a vibrant and sustainable livestock sector in the target regions.

It will study how the poor are continuing to cope and to adopt survival strategies. It will also push for more inclusive urban planning solutions.

According to the 2011 India census, close to one-third (32%) of India's population of 1.2 billion-377 million people-live in urban areas. This number is greater than the total population of the United States. The 2010 McKinsey Global Institute Report estimates that India will be home to 40% of the world's urban population by 2030. 

India's strong economic growth, largely concentrated in cities, has driven high rates of urbanization. India's small to mid-sized cities, in particular, are attracting more people as they become the epicentre of the country's economic growth. Yet, as populations increasingly urbanize, Indian cities are experiencing high levels of tension over limited resources such as land, water, and finance. 

Traditional urban planning is failing the urban poor who have survived in Indian cities by obtaining shelter, services, and work in the unregulated and untaxed informal sector. According to 2012 statistics from India's Planning Commission, some 76.5 million people (21% of the total urban population) are considered poor. The National Building Organization reports that approximately 93 million people live in slums. This population is most vulnerable to the risks inherent in unplanned rapid urbanization. India's poor regularly face losing their homes and livelihoods. Often, the cause is speculative land markets and the withdrawal of urban services, including security. The result is a marginalized population that is facing even more violence, inequality, and poverty than before the economic boom began.

The research will adopt a mixed methodology. A multidisciplinary team will develop a gender-sensitive understanding of the potential ways in which urban planning mechanisms can drive more inclusive, safer cities in India.

This project is part of the Safe and Inclusive Cities (SAIC) research initiative designed to build an evidence base on the connections between urban violence, poverty, and inequalities. Jointly funded by IDRC and the United Kingdom's Department for International Development, the SAIC program also seeks to identify the most effective strategies for addressing these challenges in Latin America and the Caribbean, South Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa.","False","False","Transaction",,"XM-DAC-301-2-107364-001",301,"CA"

Ansökande organisation:
Diakonia är en biståndsorganisation med kristna värderingar, vars huvudmän är frikyrkorna Svenska Alliansmissionen och Equmeniakyrkan. Diakonia har haft ramavtal med Sida sedan tidigt 1990-tal. Statusen som ramorganisation förnyades i början av 2014, efter att en ramkriteriebedömning genomförts. Diakonia har fyra regionkontor och 24 landkontor i Afrika, Asien, Latinamerika och Mellanöstern. 

Ansökan:
Ansökan utgör en förlängning av pågående ramprogram 2012-2014. Ansökan är inte komplett i sig själv, utan presenterar endast förändringar i förhållande till pågående program. Uppgifter som saknades i ansökan har Sida begärt in i efterhand från Diakonia. Bl.a. gäller det ett uppdaterat resultatramverk, en kostnadseffektivitetsanalys, en motivering av höjningen av budgeten samt en uppdaterad insatslista. Budgeten är inte korrekt uppställd, då indelningen av budgeten i verksamhetskostnader hos Diakonia respektive hos lokala samarbetsparter inte följer Sidas riktlinjer.

Ansökan omfattar 20 landprogram i Afrika, Asien, Latinamerika och Mellanöstern samt två regionala program i Afrika. Verksamheten är inriktad på fem tematiska områden: mänskliga rättigheter, demokrati, jämställdhet, social och ekonomisk rättvisa samt fred och försoning. Diakonia arbetar genom lokala samarbetsorganisationer. Totalt 233 ingår i denna ansökan. Kapacitetsutveckling av dessa utgör en viktig del av insatsen.

Diakonias övergripande mål är att förändra de politiska, ekonomiska, sociala och kulturella strukturer som skapar fattigdom, förtryck och våld. Diakonia stöder en bred krets av civila samhällesorganisationer med utgångspunkt från sin förändringsteori som fokuserar på medvetenhet och kunskap om rättigheter, mobilisering samt kollektivt agerande och påverkansarbete.

Förväntade resultat:
Förväntade resultat specificeras per land/regionalt program. Det är stora skillnader mellan programmen i hur resultaten utformas. Sida bedömer att de förväntade resultaten i flera fall är på en väl övergripande nivå, men de indikatorer som anges konkretiserar dem och gör dem uppföljningsbara. Exempel på förväntade resultat, ett från varje region, inom några vanliga tematiska områden är:
""Kenya: Förbättrad tillgång till rättslig prövning för rättighetsbärarna.""
""Peru: Andinska lantbrukarorganistioner och urfolksorganisationer i Amazonas genomdriver sina kollektiva rättigheter för hållbart nyttjande av naturresurser och för att minska sårbarheten vad gälller klimatförändringar, på ett jämställt, rättighetsbaserat och interkulturellt sätt, genom att utveckla sin kapacitet för påverkansarbete och för att skapa och genomföra alternativa förslag.""
""Bangladesh: Jämställdhet har stärkts och fördomar relaterade till kön har minskat"".
""Libanon: Diakonias partners har stärkt sin organisationskapacitet och tematiska kunskap."" 

Tidigare resultatuppfyllelse:
Sidas bedömning, baserat på tidigare erfarenhet och ramkriteriebedömningen är att Diakonia har god förmåga att uppnå resultaten. Resultatrapporteringen pekar ofta på resultat i termer av att rättighetsbärare har blivit stärkta och kapacitet hos samarbetsorganisationer har ökat. Exempel på tidigare resultat inom ett par områden:

Aiming to improve the nutritional status of children under five and pregnant and lactating women, WFP provided support to increase local production and distribution of Triposha-a fortified blended food similar to corn-soya blend.  

The project has evolved considerably since its inception in 2008 both in terms of WFP inputs and coverage.  By 2010, the demand for Triposha far exceeded local production capacity and the ability to ensure a steady supply of raw materials for the production. This resulted in frequent pipeline breaks and inability to reach programme targets. The Government requested WFP to procure additional soya and maize externally as well as provide advice on how to strengthen and expand the production line.  

In 2012, however, the Government instituted an import ban on soya and maize as an incentive to boost local production of these commodities, but also increasing the local prices for these items significantly. WFP and Ministry of Health (MoH) decided to import supplementary food to treat moderately acute malnourished (MAM) children and malnourished pregnant and lactating women (PLW).  

A budget revision facilitated the change in commodity and approved procurement of Super Cereal Plus as well as shifting the focus of nutrition activities from blanket supplementary feeding to targeted supplementary feeding to address MAM among children 6-59 months.  PLWs were also shifted to other Government programmes: ""Mauposha"", Jeevaposha"", and ""Poshana Malla"".

Six districts were originally targeted under the development project: Anuradhapura, Badulla, Hambantota, Moneragala, Nuwara Eliya and Rathnapura.  However, with recurring floods Ampara, Batticaloa and Trincomalee districts in the Eastern province, the development project was extended in time and added new geographic locations in September 2013 to address the deterioration of the nutritional situation among children in these areas. Another budget revision replaced Rathnapura with Polonnaruwa district due to the lower incidence of malnutrition in the former and higher rates in the latter. 

Under Strategic Objective 5 the project provided training and technical assistance to develop the national capacity of health staff and communities on nutrition and proper feeding practices. The project also contributed to the formulation process of the National Nutrition Plan and contributed to the United Nations Development Assistance Framework 2009- 2012 in reducing undernutrition among pregnant and lactating women and children through an integrated package.","False","False","Transaction",,"XM-DAC-41140-106070",966,"wfp"

Tanzania is expected to feel the effects of the global economic crisis mostly through export channels (mainly tourism, regional manufacturing exports, cash crops, and natural resources) and lower capital flows from private and possibly official assistance. Because of the structure of its trade balance, which is heavily influenced by oil on the import side and gold on the export side, the net impact is likely to be lower in Tanzania than in other countries. The financial sector is mainly sound and not exposed to global toxic assets. Tanzania's agricultural sector makes major contributions to the economy and is central to food security, household income, and poverty reduction.

The ARTF is critical to building a more functional and representative government system that is able to successfully deliver services to Afghan citizens.  The ARTF consists of two funding channels: (1) the Recurrent Cost Window, which provides funding for salaries of non-uniformed government employees and for operations and maintenance expenditures, to enable the Government of Afghanistan to deliver and manage essential services. (2) the Investment Window provides funding for priority development programs in key sectors such as education, health, agriculture, rural development, infrastructure, and governance.

Nepal and Vietnam have both made significant strides in reducing infant and maternal mortality and improving access to essential health care. However, inequality in terms of mortality and access to services between different regions and ethnic groups remains a challenge in both of these countries. This project will address this inequality by improving the health care systems of remote regions (Banke district in Nepal) and ethnic minorities in the two countries (the Thai, H’Mong, Xinh Mun, Kho Mu and Khang of Vietnam).  Project activities include: (1) improving health management capacity; (2) improving delivery of and access to quality health care and nutrition services; (3) promoting care-seeking; (4) improving nutrition; (5) engaging men and family members to reduce gender-related barriers; (6) providing capacity building to health management teams and health workers directly; (7) engaging and offering education to men and key family members on the importance of maternal, newborn and child health (MNCH) and how they can support the health of women and children; and (8) increasing the awareness of Canadians in MNCH issues through public engagement initiatives.

Although the conditions seem right for technology to create a micro-digital economy, little is known about the feasibility of the concept or how this activity may already be taking place in informal settings. This project aims to examine whether a research agenda on the ""digital sharing economy"" in low-income and marginalized communities should be established. The work will include an exploratory meeting with potential leaders in Montevideo, Uruguay. It will bring together a variety of experts to create space for new thinking and to craft a research agenda on this emerging development issue. The team will commission scoping papers to identify key gaps, questions, and methodologies that can lead to substantive empirical research. It will also develop a proposal for discussion with a wide number of stakeholders.

Until now, research in this area has focused on developed markets or formal industries in developing countries. The role of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in low-income communities has largely been limited to issues of access. However, the rise of the Information Society (the integration of ICTs into almost all domains of human activity), is progressively leading to a ""sharing economy."" These digitally enabled, collaborative efforts by individuals and institutions are driving the production of key goods that offer enormous public value, often at a low cost. 

Researchers have identified a growing number of sharing economy examples in developed countries, where access to ICTs and education levels are high. Research seems to indicate that these new modalities of collaborative or co-created production are here to stay.

Como en Safané tenemos sólo Escuela Primaria si no la ampliamos se nos queda el ciclo cortado y no hay otros Centros educativos para responder a esta necesidad. Por eso se hace imprescindible la ampliación de la Escuela con CUATRO aulas más con capacidad para 50 alumnos cada una y un despacho para el profesorado que las atienda. La construcción de las aulas para los dos primeros cursos ya se ha puesto en marcha por parte de Delwende. Para el permiso de comienzo de la fase post primaria, es necesario demostrar que se va a poder llevar a cabo el ciclo completo por lo cual se hace imprescindible terminar la construcción de las cuatro aulas.

By 2010, the demand for Triposha far exceeded local production capacity and the ability to ensure a steady supply of raw materials for the production. This resulted in frequent pipeline breaks and inability to reach programme targets. The Government requested WFP to procure additional soya and maize externally as well as provide advice on how to strengthen and expand the production line.  

In 2012, however, the Government instituted an import ban on soya and maize as an incentive to boost local production of these commodities, but also increasing the local prices for these items significantly. WFP and Ministry of Health (MoH) decided to import supplementary food to treat moderately acute malnourished (MAM) children and malnourished pregnant and lactating women (PLW).  

A budget revision facilitated the change in commodity and approved procurement of Super Cereal Plus as well as shifting the focus of nutrition activities from blanket supplementary feeding to targeted supplementary feeding to address MAM among children 6-59 months.  PLWs were also shifted to other Government programmes: ""Mauposha"", Jeevaposha"", and ""Poshana Malla"".

Six districts were originally targeted under the development project: Anuradhapura, Badulla, Hambantota, Moneragala, Nuwara Eliya and Rathnapura.  However, with recurring floods Ampara, Batticaloa and Trincomalee districts in the Eastern province, the development project was extended in time and added new geographic locations in September 2013 to address the deterioration of the nutritional situation among children in these areas. Another budget revision replaced Rathnapura with Polonnaruwa district due to the lower incidence of malnutrition in the former and higher rates in the latter. 

Under Strategic Objective 5 the project provided training and technical assistance to develop the national capacity of health staff and communities on nutrition and proper feeding practices. The project also contributed to the formulation process of the National Nutrition Plan and contributed to the United Nations Development Assistance Framework 2009- 2012 in reducing undernutrition among pregnant and lactating women and children through an integrated package.","False","False","Transaction",,"XM-DAC-41140-106070",966,"wfp"

WFP also aligned its work with the government priority to fight acute and chronic malnutrition (WFP's strategic objective 4: ""Reduce undernutrition and break the intergenerational cycle of hunger""). WFP's activities included the treatment of acute malnutrition in children 6-59 months old and the prevention of chronic malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies in infants by focusing on the first 1,000 days.

However original design envisaged full equipment of all forestry units in the project area (including patrol cars, tractors etc.) which is now not necessary as Government has been improving and will continue to improve material resources of the forestry units barring any unexpected severe financial and budgetary crisis. Reduction in forestry related civil works in the part A of the project is possible due to less expensive project support of planting activities performed with Borrower's own funds. The project will do more site preparation and experimental planting.

Activities targeting rural and urban communities to alleviate hunger and reduce undernutrition as well as to enhance resilience were complemented by broader capacity development initiatives such as disaster risk reduction management and emergency simulation exercises.  

WFP's humanitarian assistance included the provision of food or cash-based transfers (CBT) to internally displaced persons (IDPs) and returnees affected by conflict, to people affected by economic stress or natural disasters, such as floods and landslides, as well as for the treatment of acutely malnourished children under five years of age and pregnant and lactating women (PLW). According to the Afghanistan National Nutrition Survey (NNS) 2013, 40.9 percent of children under five were chronically malnourished (stunted), 9.5 percent were acutely malnourished (wasted) and 24.6 percent underweight. 

The context of maternal and child nutrition status is characterised by a high prevalence of malnutrition, including micronutrient deficiencies, due to inadequate dietary intake, frequent infections and poor maternal outcomes. Maternal undernutrition is equally concerning with one-fifth of adolescent girls and women of reproductive age undernourished (low body mass index). Underweight women are more likely to give birth to low birthweight babies at higher risk of neonatal and infant death and stunted growth. The NNS 2013 showed that women and adolescent girls who had little or no formal education or came from impoverished households were more likely to be malnourished and deficient in essential micronutrients.

As part of its recovery strategy, WFP supported communities in their efforts to build productive assets that increase agricultural productivity and strengthen resilience to shocks. Additionally, WFP's recovery activities contributed to increased enrolment, attendance and learning capacity among primary and lower secondary school pupils through take-home rations, and among adults, particularly women, through vocational skills training activities.

Aligned with WFP Strategic Objectives 1, 2 and 4, the PRRO aimed to:

- respond to the food security and nutritional needs of IDPs and returnees affected by conflict, and people affected by natural disasters and economic stress (under Strategic Objective 1); 
- support the recovery of communities affected by shocks (under Strategic Objective 2); 
- treat moderately malnourished children under-5 and PLW (under Strategic Objective 4); 
- contribute to learning among primary and lower secondary school pupils and adults, particularly women (under Strategic Objective 4). 

Under capacity development, WFP's Purchase for Progress (P4P) initiative continued to procure locally produced high-energy biscuits (HEB) for emergency response, wheat grain from local small-holder farmer organizations and also to connect farmers with millers in order to create a sustainable institutional market for their surplus. This contributed to WFP's shift to more nutrition-sensitive entitlement baskets in mid-2015. WFP facilitated capacity development events for government staff, farmers and national counterparts. Training included major disaster response simulation exercises, with a focus on emergency preparedness and response capacity, food security analysis and disaster risk reduction (DRR).

The PRRO is aligned with the United Nations Development Assistance Framework (2014-2017) and the Government's National Priority Programmes under the Afghanistan National Development Strategy.

strong economic growth over the past 10 years, Angola?s economy is heavily dependent
on the oil sector. Furthermore, on the social front, the country suffers from high
unemployment which affects 26 % of the active population. The incidence of poverty remains
high with about 36.6% of the population living below the poverty line. Against this backdrop,
the Government of Angola has set the objective of promoting human development, improving
the quality of life and combating extreme poverty through diversification of the economy and
employment.
In order to diversify its economy, the Government has undertaken various initiatives to
foster private sector development under the 2013-2017 National Development Plan. The
4-year project for an amount of USD 27.64 million aims to contribute to the country?s private
sector development efforts. Its objective is to build the institutional capacity of public services
which provide support to private sector development and to train their personnel. The project
will also contribute to the establishment of a monitoring and evaluation system for assessing
the actual impact of these private sector support initiatives and enhancing their effectiveness.","False","False","Budget",1,"46002-P-AO-K00-006",913,"afdb"

Se trata de un territorio con una amplia tradición agrícola y acuícola, con una población ampliamente rural, cuya historia fue marcada por procesos de reasentamientos poblacionales derivados de la firma de los Acuerdos de Paz, que derivaron en altos índices de pobreza, exclusión y marginación social en detrimento de la calidad de vida de los pobladores de estos territorios, así como en un acelerado deterioro del medio ambiente.Por un lado, aunque el territorio cuenta con una gran riqueza en recursos naturales, los sectores productivos, específicamente el sector camaronero, enfrentan dificultades para identificar, ampliar y consolidar un circuito de comercialización adecuado con sus respectivos nichos de mercado local y nacional, así como, para el manejo adecuado de herramientas técnicas que les permitan mejorar la calidad de su producción bajo prácticas sostenibles y amigables con el medio ambiente. Por otro lado, si bien existe un importante capital social basado en un tejido de organizaciones comunitarias, aún hace falta articular redes y consolidar espacios de diálogo inclusivos en términos de género y juventud, aplicando herramientas de gestión que contribuyan a una mayor generación de valor de su riqueza cultural. Atendiendo a esa situación, la Fundación ETEA conjuntamente con la Asociación Local Mangle, para la Mitigación de Desastres y el Desarrollo en el Bajo Lempa, Bahía de Jiquilisco, la Asociación Intermunicipal Bahía de Jiquilisco (ASIBAHÍA) y la Universidad Centroamericana José Simeón Cañas (UCA) aúnan esfuerzos para implementar un proyecto orientado a apoyar a los productores camaroneros de los 6 municipios antes mencionados, mediante equipamiento y asistencia técnica que les permita elevar su capacidad productiva y generar circuitos de comercialización, con puntos de venta comprometidos, así como, a contribuir al fortalecimiento organizativo de grupos poblacionales tradicionalmente excluidos, como son, mujeres y jóvenes, mediante acciones que conlleven a mejorar su capacidad de incidencia en los procesos e iniciativas de desarrollo a nivel territorial, a promover su identidad cultural y al fortalecimiento de iniciativas territoriales como el Grupo de Acción Territorial (GAT). A través de ellos, se desarrollará una estrategia de intervención que permita alcanzar los resultados del proyecto, la sostenibilidad del mismo y que contribuya a la reducción de la pobreza y a la mejora de la calidad de vida de los grupos destinatarios. Para ello, la propuesta se articula en torno a 4 componentes:a) Fortalecimiento institucional y organizativo; b) Fortalecimiento de estructuras productivas territoriales;c) Prácticas ambientales sostenibles; y d) Gestión del conocimiento.""","False","False","Budget",,"ES-DIR3-E04585801-009-078485",50,"ES"
