Despite not being a signatory on the 1951 Geneva Convention nor the 1967 Protocol on the status of refugees, the Government of Nepal has generously hosted thousands of refugees from Bhutan. For two decades, the refugees have been recognized on a prima facie basis. Nevertheless, refugees from Bhutan are considered foreigners in Nepal without political rights, and cannot own land or gain legal employment outside the camps. Therefore, they predominantly rely on external assistance. An ongoing programme of third country resettlement since 2008 has reduced the number of refugees from an initial 107,810 to 23,415 persons as of November 2014. Although a date for the completion of the programme is not foreseen, it is projected that some 13,000 refugees will remain in Nepal either as non-declarants of interest or as residual cases who are either pending resettlement or ineligible for resettlement.

In line with WFP Strategic Objective 1, the PRRO 200136 provided support to the Bhutanese refugee community in eastern Nepal. The project was approved for a period of three years (January 2011 to December 2013), and aimed at providing refugees secure access to food, stabilizing nutritional status, and enhancing livelihoods through supplementary activities. These objectives were achieved through general food distributions, nutrition and livelihoods-related activities. Complementary activities that aimed at strengthening livelihoods and raising awareness among the refugees and host communities, included vocational training (VT), a reclamation gardening programme (RGP), and theatre for development (TFD) shows on nutrition, sanitation, sexually transmitted infections and HIV/AIDS.

About the Opportunity Fund
In December 2013, TTI launched a call for proposals for the end of the Phase 1 Opportunity Fund. This fund supports TTI grantee organizations' efforts to achieve their long-term objectives. These are projects that cannot otherwise be carried out through use of TTI core funding. 

The purpose of the Opportunity Fund is to provide supplementary funding for activities that are not already budgeted for in the organizations' TTI work plans for 2013-2014. To be eligible for support, applicant TTI grantees will allocate and fully spend all their Phase 1 core funding by September 30, 2014.

Several TTI grantee institutions submitted research support proposals in response to the Opportunity Fund call. Selected proposals came from the following institutions:
-Fundación Dr Guillermo Manuel Ungo, El Salvador
-Fundación INESAD, Bolivia
-Foro Social de la Deuda Externa de Honduras, Honduras
-Instituto de Estudios Peruanos, Peru
-Fundación ""ARU"", Bolivia
-Fundación Salvadoreña para el Desarrollo Económico y Social, El Salvador

These proposals fulfill the call's requirements and comprise a variety of activities that will provide institutional support and foster collaboration among think tanks. 

The proposed activities include publications, capacity-building consultancies, and efforts to consolidate academic networks. In all cases, the activities align with each institution's objectives as listed in their TTI core funding grant agreements.","False","False","Transaction",,"idrccrdi","CA"

Earlier IDRC-supported research analyzed and compared the diverse paths and development strategies of BRICS countries from the point of view of national innovation systems. A key finding is that the benefits of innovations rarely address the needs of the poor because most policies and systems that support science, technology, and innovation target economic growth and competitiveness, not reducing poverty or inequalities.

-  build the capacity of PhD students and policymakers gathering at the Rio de Janeiro GLOBELICS Academy in August 2012;
-  develop a framework to capture the dynamics of socially inclusive innovation systems that are not usually evident to policymakers; and
- expand the BRICS research network to include other developing countries.

It also aims to foster a better understanding of how innovation and social inclusion operate in emerging economies.

The mortality rate for children less than five years of age is 73/1000 live births in Kenya and 108/1000, in Côte d’Ivoire, in 2015. Vitamin A deficiency and worm infection causes and worsens malnutrition, anemia and diseases, particularly diarrheal diseases, which are a leading cause of death for children less than five years of age in these countries. Currently, these services are provided in both countries through schools, leaving children younger than five years unreached; a gap which this project is addressing. This project is providing improved delivery of these essential health services in communities where the actual coverage for children under five years of age is low.  Project activities include: (1) increasing access to vitamin A and preventative de-worming treatments using existing community-based delivery systems; (2) strengthening the local health care system by training local health workers and community health volunteers in vitamin A supplementation and de-worming; (3) creating and utilizing a standardized toolkit for training on the implementation of responsive combined deworming and Vitamin A supplementation program targeting pre-school aged children; and (4) improving community engagement around vitamin A deficiency and de-worming in young children through responsive communication and engagement plans implementation as well as participatory activities with communities members, community leaderships and health structures and other gender equality and women’s groups.  The local partners are the Medical Assistance Programs in Kenya and Cote d'Ivoire which implement this project in 5 regions of Côte d'Ivoire (Gneby-Tiassa-Me, Bélier, Bounkani-Gontougo, Gbeke, Gôh and Indenie Duablin) and in three counties of Kenya (Siaya, Kwale and Kilifi). Vitamin Angels, a US-based NGO, is also a partner and provides in-kind contributions of albendazole (de-worming treatments) and vitamin A supplements for the duration of the project.  This project directly impacts 1.4 million children and 16,600 adults working as community health workers or volunteers. It will also indirectly impact more than 5 million people who will benefit from positive outcomes on health in the community.","False","False","Budget",1,"gac-amc","CA"

Traditional donors have withdrawn their funding. With stronger economies, governments in the region have increased spending on science, technology, and innovation (STI). They have also enhanced their outgoing international scientific cooperation.

Despite the signs pointing to increased regional cooperation in STI for development, there are large knowledge gaps about the details of this type of collaboration. These can only begin to be filled by answering the following questions: 
-Are efforts to support applied research for development the outcome of deliberate political decisions to support this type of research or the result of a bottom-up demand to dedicate STI resources, or a combination of both? 
- What proportion of new and existing STI funding is being dedicated to research for development in countries leading the push for more STI funding in the region? 
- How does each country define this type of applied research? 
- How do these countries partner with neighbouring countries, or countries facing similar socio-economic challenges, for research for development projects? 
- What specific research issues do these countries wish to pursue through collaboration with other countries in the Americas? 
- Is research on the determinants of equitable economic growth and sustainable development present in these work agendas? How?

This project will establish four Joint Scientific Chairs for Research for Development in the Americas to support and manage cooperation in research for development in the Americas. This support will be offered in collaboration with local partners (national or state science granting councils or other public research funding agencies) in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Mexico. Chairs will focus their research on hemispheric cooperation. They will also examine their country's role in supporting research for equitable and sustainable development at the national and regional levels. They will study and share evidence from successful Latin American cases. In doing so, the Chairs will improve domestic and international communication and coordination on the role of science and research in development. Ultimately, this will help stimulate this type of cooperation in the future.

IDRC will contribute a maximum of $200,000 for each Chair to implement a research program which considers the characteristics of each country and its focus area of cooperation within the region. Chairs will be located in research institutions with sound track records of collaborating with the national scientific granting councils from each of the four countries. IDRC and a national scientific granting agency from each of the four countries will manage the selection process.","False","False","Transaction",,"idrccrdi","CA"

The program aims to develop robust evidence to inform policies and practices capable of increasing the resilience of vulnerable populations. Its geographic focus consists of ""hot spots"" in Africa and Asia: semi-arid zones, mega-deltas and densely populated river basins (including glacier-fed systems). These hot spots combine two factors: significant impacts in the biophysical environment from climate change, and high risks to the livelihood of a large number of poor people with limited capacity to adapt.

Using different socio-economic scenarios and climate warming scenarios, researchers will develop a better understanding of the conditions that make poor people vulnerable to climate change. As well, researchers will identify sustainable adaptation measures that can be promoted within and across the hot spots. Research findings will provide decision-makers at the local, national and regional levels with robust scientific evidence needed to policies and programs capable of increasing the resilience of vulnerable populations to climate change.

Cameroon, Chad and Niger. In the beginning of 2014, numbers were relatively low and populations were supported under
WFP or partner existing activities. However, growing insecurity in 2014 led to important peaks in arrivals, in particular in August, bringing the need to activate a regional response. The continuation of widespread violence in Northeastern Nigeria and neighboring countries has caused massive population movements in the four Lake Chad Basin Countries with destruction of livelihoods and assets.

As the tensions in northern Nigeria intensified through 2015, there was a sharp increase in population displacement which further deprived chronically poor areas. Border countries therefore continued to support refugees, returnees, vulnerable host populations and internally displaced persons (IDPs) affected by the crisis.
Insecurity, displacement, disrupted agricultural activities, and cross border trade, which further undermined communities' livelihoods and led to a limited access to and availability of food. The disruption of farming activities in Cameroon, of trade and local farming in Chad and of the export of fish and livestock in Niger all contributed to an increasing level of food insecurity in the region.

By mid-October 2015, more than 4.7 million people were in moderate and severe food insecurity in Cameroon, Chad and Niger as well as Nigeria, the heart of the crisis.

In this context, in which the crisis has exacerbated the food insecurity of IDPs, refugees, returnees, and has greatly affected the coping strategies of local populations, the regional EMOP seeks to address these critical food and nutrition needs in the three Lake Chad Basin Countries (LCBC) of Cameroon, Chad and Niger. In Nigeria, as of September 2015, WFP signed memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) to provide capacity strengthening to their response to the crisis in the North East.

Specifically, the EMOP aims to:
(i) Ensure the food needs of crisis-affected populations through flexible and context-specific responses;
(ii) Stabilize the nutrition situation of crisis-affected children through robust prevention programmes adapted to nutrition indicators of population groups;

In line with the WFP Strategic Plan, the project contributes to Strategic Objective 1, ""Save lives and protect livelihoods in emergencies.""

Launched in January 2015, the regional emergency operation for the Lac Chad Basin supports populations displaced by the insecurity in northern Nigeria by the Boko Haram crisis. WFP has scaled up its operations throughout the year in response to multiple population movements resulting from cross-border attacks.

Under this EMOP, in response to rising food insecurity, malnutrition risks and continued displacement in the Lake Chad Basin, WFP aims at providing equitable assistance to the women and men within the refugee, IDP and local communities. Special efforts were made to provide a dedicated attention to gender considerations, in particular raising awareness to reduce the risk of sexual and gender-based violence in border areas and camps.

In Nigeria, in line with the MoU and in order to enable a hands on support by experienced WFP staff, WFP set up a base in Borno and Yobe Northern Nigerian states. Technical workshops on emergency management capacities were delivered to participants from national and state emergency agencies and partners.

WFP also supported the roll-out of the Cadre Harmonise regional food security classification framework in Nigeria. At the request of the Humanitarian Coordinator, in mid-2015 WFP launched United Nations Humanitarian Air Services (UNHAS) connecting humanitarian responders to the capital and northern states.","False","False","Budget",2,"wfp","wfp"

Transmission in the south occurs all-year round, and is more seasonal in the north. Almost all cases are caused by P. falciparum but most cases are unconfirmed. 
Through programs funded through the second and fourth rounds of Global Fund financing, the Global Fund has contributed to the availability and distribution of health products, training of health workers and improved access to private and public outlets in 18 states of the country. Although national coverage of key malaria control interventions are still low (less than 10%), in some of the targeted states coverage is about 30% and up to 60% in some Local Government Areas (LGAs) according to national surveys. This Program aims to build on these successes by expanding and scaling-up proven interventions throughout all the States of the Federation.
This Program is based on the National Malaria Strategic Plan, which is line with the revised Abuja Roll Back Malaria (RBM) targets towards scaling up malaria interventions and health systems strengthening. Activities are aligned to the long-term reduction of malaria through universal coverage of key interventions, with special focus on pregnant women, children under five and the rural poor. It aims to rapidly ""catch-up"" on the RBM 2010 coverage targets as well as respond directly to the call from the United Nations Secretary General made in April 2008 for countries to attain universal coverage of key interventions by 31 December 2010. 
This Program will be complementary to the efforts of the Government of Nigeria, the World Bank, the Department for International Development (DFID), United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI), The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), UNITAID, other partners and the private sector.  

The key interventions for the Program are: to contribute to universal coverage of Long-Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs) for disease prevention through mass campaigns and routine distribution, to increase Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) rollout in the public and private sector, to increase malaria diagnosis using microscopy at referral centers and rollout of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) at primary health facilities. The implementation plan is based on extensive and innovative community delivery systems with sector wide public-private partnership and use of civil society organizations. It also focuses on strengthening the health systems and a well coordinated and targeted BCC to increase the correct utilization of the services, improve results based M&E and community systems strengthening.

This Program will be implemented by three principal recipients, which are, at the time of signature of this Agreement, the National Malaria Control Programme of the Federal Ministry of Health of the Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (the Principal Recipient, or ""NMCP""), the Yakubu Gowon Center for National Unity and International Cooperation (""YGC"") and the Society for Family Health (""SFH"").

The AMFm in Nigeria will facilitate more rapid achievement of universal access to high quality, affordable ACTs in all sectors.

While there are many ways to assess research quality, one of the strategies adopted by the Initiative is to carry out a peer-review exercise. For each TTI grantee, two research outputs were evaluated by independent reviewers at the beginning and at the end of Phase 1.

The peer review will again be carried out twice for each grantee in Phase 2 in order to determine whether there are marked differences in the institution's capacity to produce high quality policy-relevant research. Fourteen grantees have been asked to provide two written research outputs for review that were produced between October 2014 and December 2015. An evaluation form for research outputs was developed for the Phase 1 peer-review exercise. It will again be filled out by the reviewer of each output, with minor adjustments reflecting the incorporation of gender dimensions of research, inclusion principles, and a question around research ethics.

Reviewers will be selected based on their previous collaboration with the TTI peer-review process. Where necessary, new reviewers, identified by TTI and other IDRC staff, will also be recruited according to their level of education and experience and the absence of any institutional linkages with the grantees. Upon completion of this process, the results of the peer review will be shared with each grantee. 

The Think Tank Initiative (TTI) is a multi-funder program dedicated to strengthening independent policy research institutions, or think tanks, in developing countries. The program aims to enhance their ability to provide sound research that informs and influences policy. The second TTI phase (2014-2019) will fund 43 institutions, helping them consolidate their role as credible development actors in their countries, and in some cases, regionally and internationally.

Others with laws on the books are less so: in Zimbabwe the ATI law restricts information flow while Angola, Uganda and Ethiopia lack the resources, capacity or commitment to fully implement and enforce their laws.

Recent experience suggests that despite obstacles, many citizens and local organizations in Africa area able to access information even in the absence of an ATI law. Environmental justice advocates have, for example, used constitutional provisions, environmental and natural resource laws, regional declarations, international accords, and other instruments to access information. Such sectoral efforts have contributed to a groundswell of demand for a comprehensive ATI law and other systemic reforms consistent with democratic governance, including the infrastructure of transparency.

This grant will allow the World Resources Institute to partner with the Centre for Democratic Development in Ghana, Greenwatch in Uganda, and the Open Democracy Advice Centre in South Africa to better understand transparency models and lessons learned from ATI practice in other African countries, with a focus the environmental sector. Project outputs will include country reports, two comparative research reports, various capacity building outreach and activities.

Aligned with United Nations Joint Vision for Sierra Leone and WFP Strategic Objectives 2, and 4 of the Strategic Results Framework, the CP focused on increasing access to basic education, improving nutrition, and livelihood. The CP, with the exception of food and nutritional support to ART clients and their households, was put on hold in June 2014 when the Ebola outbreak prevented large gatherings and resulted in movement restrictions and a collapse of non-Ebola related health services. WFP was not able to resume the majority of the CP activities due to the continued presence of the virus through most of 2015 and the ongoing discussion with government over programme resumption and implementation. 

Improving the quality of and access to education are priorities of the government under pillar three of the Agenda for Prosperity (A4P). WFP aimed to support this pillar through component 1 of the CP, the school feeding programme. In order to bridge the gender gap, the CP intended to provide a take home ration as an incentive for parents to send their girls to school and to keep them there.  The school feeding programme and take home ration was not resumed in 2015 due to ongoing discussions with the government for the roll-out of a government-led national school feeding programme. 

Overall, the population of Sierra Leone has a poor nutritional status attributable to the high levels of stunting and micronutrient deficiencies at varying levels across the country. Component 2 of the CP intended to focus on providing nutritional support to malnourished and vulnerable children aged 6-59 months, pregnant and lactating women (PLW) through targeted supplementary feeding, ART clients and their households through targeted supplementary feeding, and complementary feeding for children aged 6-23 months. Supplementary feeding through health centers for moderately acute malnourished children and PLW was significantly disrupted as capacity to provide healthcare services outside of Ebola was unavailable, combined with community fear of health facilities. In November, the targeted supplementary feeding programme (TSFP) was resumed and expanded under the CP to include both children age 6-59 months and pregnant and lactating women (PLW). Complementary feeding was removed under the Budget Revision as other nutrition interventions were considered to have a larger impact and greater coverage. 

Despite the suspension of the CP activities, malnourished ART clients continued to receive food-by-prescription while their families received household food support.  This helped to ensure that this already vulnerable group continued to receive support throughout the Ebola outbreak so that ART adherence and nutritional status was maintained. 

In order to address the poor infrastructure which continues to threaten food security, the CP aimed to build agricultural assets and helped to achieve adequate food consumption levels mostly through the Cash for Assets (CFA) programme. As agriculture is a core pillar in the A4P and the government's Poverty Reduction Strategy for 2013-2018, the CP supported agricultural growth through component 5 of the government's Smallholder Commercialization Programme. However, like other CP activities, the livelihoods component was put on hold from June 2014 due to the Ebola outbreak and was not resumed in 2015.","False","False","Transaction",,"wfp","wfp"

Insatsen har genomförts i en första program-fas av Svenska kyrkan i samarbete med omkring 110 lokala civila samhällsorganisationer (CSO), trosbaserade organisationer och lokala kyrkor i flertalet länder i Afrika, Asien, Latinamerika och Mellanöstern under 2014-2016 med stöd från Sida/CIVSAM som uppgått till 291 000 000 SEK, i syfte att stärka civilsamhällets kapacitet och bidra till följande program-mål:

-	Människors rätt till sexuell och reproduktiv hälsa och rättigheter har stärkts.
-	Människor som lever i utsatthet har rätt till grundläggande trygghet och har stärkt social och ekonomisk egenmakt.
-	Människor har fått ökad trygghet, möjlighet och egenmakt att hantera konflikter och delta i freds- och försoningsprocesser.
-	Kvinnor och män har förbättrade förutsättningar och möjligheter till jämställt deltagande, röst och ledarskap i kyrka och samhälle.
-	Människors rätt till kroppslig och sexuell integritet i kyrka och samhälle har stärkts. 

Svenska kyrkan har föreslagit en förlängning av insatsen, på basis av dess existerande resultatramverk, med en budget på 119 419 916 SEK för år 2017 vilket motsvarar en ökning om 23% jämfört med föregående år. Utifrån en samlad bedömning och med hänsyn till tillgängliga anslagsmedel föreslås i Sidas beredning att ansökan för 2017 finansieras med 105 000 000 SEK. Ny total budget för insatsen 2014-2017 blir därmed 396 000 000 SEK.

För år 2017 har Svenska kyrkan budgeterat för utbetalningar till lokala samarbetsparter till en summa på 108 523 921 SEK, varav 94 904 250 SEK ingår i ansökan för 2017 och resterande del är utbetalningar av Sida-medel som redan är avtalade inom Svenska kyrkans EU-projekt. Denna totala andel som vidareförmedlas uppgår till 70% av totala budgeten för ram-insatsen och den redan avtalade EU-insatsen, beräknat på andelen utbetalningar som går direkt till lokala parter som Svenska kyrkan har avtal med. Att Svenska kyrkan räknar in Sida-stödet till egeninsatsen till sitt EU-projekt i andelen som vidareförmedlas påverkar inte bedömningen av ansökan för 2017. För tydlighetens skull kommer dock Sida be Svenska kyrkan att redovisa Sida-stödet till EU-insatsen separat i nästa ansökan. Av de medel som vidareförmedlas 2017 kommer 46 MSEK fördelas till parter i Afrika (Etiopien, Liberia, Sydafrika, Sydsudan, Uganda och Zimbabwe), 11,5 MSEK till Asien (Indien och Burma/Myanmar), 23 MSEK till Latinamerika (Colombia, Guatemala, Honduras och Haiti), och 14,4 MSEK till Mellanöstern (Egypten och Israel/Palestina). Inga utbetalningar kommer att ske till internationella avtalsparter eller svenska CSO. 

De lokala samarbetsparterna uppgår till omkring 110 CSO och/eller CSO-nätverk. Storleken på bidragen varierar mellan 80 000 SEK till omkring 5 MSEK. Svenska kyrkan räknar Lutherska världsförbundets (LVF) lokala/nationellt registrerade landkontor bland sina lokala CSO-partners. Svenska kyrkans samarbete med de lokala LVF-programmen utgör en stor andel av det totala stöd som förmedlas – närmare 22 %. I förlängningsansökan 2017 motsvarar det totalt 24,5 MSEK. Av dessa går 282 000 SEK till ett globalt program som administreras av kontoret i Genève – alla övriga medel går direkt till LVF:s landprogram och det arbete dessa kontor bedriver självständigt i samverkan med lokala CSO. Med egna medel stödjer Svenska kyrkan utöver detta den koordinerande funktionen i Geneve med 4,9 MSEK 2017, vilket kommer det lokala arbetet till godo bland annat gällande kvalitetssäkring och utvärdering. Medan den koordinerande funktionen via LVF i Genève bidrar med kvalitetssäkring av LVF-projekten, genomför Svenska kyrkans personal kvalitetssäkringen av övriga projekt inom programmet.

Verksamhetskostnaderna hos Svenska kyrkan, vilket inkluderar kostnader som relaterar till handläggning av Sida-finansierade program och projekt, inklusive lön, fältbesök etc, kommer att uppgå till 16 679 000 SEK år 2017.

To support government accountability and private sector regulation, this operation supports policy actions that introduce a new procurement monitoring system; and legislation to establish a multi sector energy regulator. To support a more dynamic and inclusive economy, the operation supports submission of a revised Foreign Investment Bill to the Legislative Assembly (LA); and the commercialization of two public enterprises (PEs).","False","False","Transaction",,"worldbank","ida"

The CP was approved by the Executive Board in 2012 and is in line with Strategic Objective 3 and 4 of the WFP Strategic Plan for 2014-2017. The overall objective of the CP is to strengthen local and national capacities in order to break the intergenerational cycle of hunger. Specifically, WFP aims to enhance food and nutrition security by improving education, nutrition and health throughout the life cycle; to strengthen communities' resilience by mitigating shocks and adapting to climate change; to link the demand of local food-based assistance programmes to small farmers, thereby transforming food and nutrition assistance into productive investments in local communities; and to strengthen government capacity to design, manage and implement tools, policies and programmes for assessing and reducing hunger.

The CP has three components:

1. A sustainable and productive school feeding programme, with the specific objectives of increasing primary school enrolment and ensuring completion; alleviating short-term hunger and preventing micronutrient deficiencies among schoolchildren; and providing technical assistance to connecting farmers to markets by the use of local food products for school feeding. (WFP Strategic Objective 4)

2. Support government nutrition programmes to prevent stunting and reduce low birth weight through the provision of nutrition education and complementary food distributions to pregnant and lactating women. (WFP Strategic Objective 4)

3. Livelihoods development and disaster risk reduction to strengthen communities' resilience. Conditional food assistance linked to asset creation activities will mitigate shocks, support adaptation to climate change and improve household food security. (WFP Strategic Objective 3)

All components include capacity development and augmentation activities to support the government in managing national food-based safety nets and to strengthen the implementation of food security and sovereignty policies. Components were built upon past cooperation, partnerships with United Nations agencies and NGOs in order to support government social policies and legal framework applying to nutrition, school feeding and local food production.","False","False","Budget",2,"wfp","wfp"

Aligned with United Nations Joint Vision for Sierra Leone and WFP Strategic Objectives 2, and 4 of the Strategic Results Framework, the CP focused on increasing access to basic education, improving nutrition, and livelihood. The CP, with the exception of food and nutritional support to ART clients and their households, was put on hold in June 2014 when the Ebola outbreak prevented large gatherings and resulted in movement restrictions and a collapse of non-Ebola related health services. WFP was not able to resume the majority of the CP activities due to the continued presence of the virus through most of 2015 and the ongoing discussion with government over programme resumption and implementation. 

Improving the quality of and access to education are priorities of the government under pillar three of the Agenda for Prosperity (A4P). WFP aimed to support this pillar through component 1 of the CP, the school feeding programme. In order to bridge the gender gap, the CP intended to provide a take home ration as an incentive for parents to send their girls to school and to keep them there.  The school feeding programme and take home ration was not resumed in 2015 due to ongoing discussions with the government for the roll-out of a government-led national school feeding programme. 

Overall, the population of Sierra Leone has a poor nutritional status attributable to the high levels of stunting and micronutrient deficiencies at varying levels across the country. Component 2 of the CP intended to focus on providing nutritional support to malnourished and vulnerable children aged 6-59 months, pregnant and lactating women (PLW) through targeted supplementary feeding, ART clients and their households through targeted supplementary feeding, and complementary feeding for children aged 6-23 months. Supplementary feeding through health centers for moderately acute malnourished children and PLW was significantly disrupted as capacity to provide healthcare services outside of Ebola was unavailable, combined with community fear of health facilities. In November, the targeted supplementary feeding programme (TSFP) was resumed and expanded under the CP to include both children age 6-59 months and pregnant and lactating women (PLW). Complementary feeding was removed under the Budget Revision as other nutrition interventions were considered to have a larger impact and greater coverage. 

Despite the suspension of the CP activities, malnourished ART clients continued to receive food-by-prescription while their families received household food support.  This helped to ensure that this already vulnerable group continued to receive support throughout the Ebola outbreak so that ART adherence and nutritional status was maintained. 

In order to address the poor infrastructure which continues to threaten food security, the CP aimed to build agricultural assets and helped to achieve adequate food consumption levels mostly through the Cash for Assets (CFA) programme. As agriculture is a core pillar in the A4P and the government's Poverty Reduction Strategy for 2013-2018, the CP supported agricultural growth through component 5 of the government's Smallholder Commercialization Programme.

About GRADE
Located in Lima, Peru, GRADE is a private, non-profit, non-political research centre. Its mission is to conduct applied research to stimulate and enrich public policy debate, design, and implementation. Since 1980, GRADE has devoted itself to economic, educational, environmental, and social research in areas relevant to Peru and Latin America's development. It receives its funding from the Think Tank Initiative (TTI).

Partnering for strong institutions
TTI is a multi-funder program dedicated to strengthening independent policy research institutions, or think tanks, in developing countries. The program aims to enhance their ability to provide sound research that informs and influences policy. 

This second TTI phase (2014-2019) will fund 43 institutions, helping them consolidate their role as credible development actors in their countries, and in some cases, regionally and internationally. For GRADE, this project will help enhance its research quality, organizational performance, and policy engagement. 

Building a first-class think tank
Through this support over the next 4.5 years, GRADE is expected to
-develop a research agenda that enhances internal coordination and responds to relevant policy areas in Peru at the regional level, and using a territorial approach
-encourage its research staff to undertake relevant research and engage more fully with policymakers in Peru
-enhance its capacity to influence policy dialogue and policy-making in Peru through more high-quality publications and research outputs
-test, refine, and develop new strategies for financial sustainability

Over this period, GRADE is expected to become a first-rate think tank with a stronger presence at the local, regional, and international levels.

Although some low- and middle-income countries invest considerable resources in building scientific capacity, the majority have weak scientific capacity. But, there are signs of change in how governments support and promote public science. New science granting councils, new directions, and new partnerships merit further investigation. 

For example, countries such as Panama have created new agencies to fund science and innovation. In the face of change, other countries, such as Egypt and others affected by the Arab Spring, are rethinking their existing science policies and support instruments. Finally, countries with significant scientific capabilities such as South Africa, Brazil, and China may begin or increase support to scientific research outside their borders.

This project seeks to better understand these recent developments and to promote learning among science granting councils to strengthen practices and promote cooperation. In support of this, IDRC will facilitate regional and inter-regional workshops. The goal is to allow peer organizations to exchange ideas on topics of mutual interest.  Representatives from science granting councils will have the chance to exchange information on thematic programming, discuss operational and strategic challenges, and explore areas for collaboration. All activities will support IDRC's long-standing mandate of encouraging research coordination and fostering cooperation.

With estimated HIV prevalence of less than 0.1% (2009 UNAIDS Country Brief), Bangladesh is a low HIV prevalence country. UNAIDS estimates about 12,000 people in Bangladesh to be living with HIV at the end of 2007. As of December 2008, a total of 1495 cases of HIV infection were confirmed, with 476 of them developing AIDS and 165 reported death cases (National HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan). The Sero Surveillance Report findings show that HIV infection rate is increasing among most-at-risk-population (MARP), particularly among injecting drug users (IDUs) with concentrated epidemic in Dhaka (7%), and among female sex workers (FSW) due to low level of condom use.

Despite the low HIV prevalence in Bangladesh, several risk factors, including geographical location, high population mobility, a large number of migrant workers, poverty, and low level of awareness among young people threaten to hamper the continuing status of Bangladesh as a low HIV prevalence country. The HIV Joint Monitoring Mission organized by the World Bank and its key partners in February 2009 found that prompt and vigorous action is needed to strengthen the quality and coverage of HIV prevention programs, particularly amongst IDUs. HIV/AIDS Program in Bangladesh is part of the Health, Nutrition and Population Sector Program (HNPSP), which addresses the Millennium Development Goals and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) through a pool of multiple funding and donor consortia.

The main objectives of the Global Fund-financed HIV/AIDS Rolling Continuation Chanel (RCC) Program are: 

1. Increasing the scale of prevention services for key populations at higher risk (IDUs, FSW, hijras (transgender population) and men having sex with men (MSM));
2. Increasing the scale of the most effective activities conducted with the Global Fund Round 2  HIV/AIDS Program; and
3. Building capacity of partners in order to increase the scale of the national response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

The Program objectives complement the continuation and scaling up of relevant interventions from the Global Fund-financed Round 2 HIV/AIDS Program (BAN-202-G01-H-00) in the major areas of behavior change communication (BCC) using mass media, HIV and AIDS information in formal and non-formal educational institutions, advocacy to create an enabling environment, and capacity building for implementers. In addition, they include new interventions resulting from the change in scope and scale of activities under the Round 2 Program, i.e. harm reduction services for IDUs, prevention services for FSW working in the streets, hotels and residences, prevention services for hijras and MSM, and national capacity building, including improvement of national monitoring and evaluation system.  
This RCC Program will be implemented by three principal recipients: Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of the Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh (the ""Principal Recipient""), Save the Children USA, and the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Diseases Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR’B).

Initially, WFP launched two separate Special Operations dedicated to air operations (SO 200760) and logistics and telecommunications services (SO 200767). Subsequently, WFP launched SO 200773 that consolidated, expanded and superseded the two SOs from 15 October 2014 to 28 February 2015. The SO underwent three budget revisions to adjust the timeframe of operations and the requirements to the evolving outbreak, ensuring the flexibility necessary to adapt the provision of services to accommodate critical needs, to prioritize activities identified by health partners.
 
The regional SO acted as an enabler for the UN and NGO partners involved in the response to the Ebola emergency under the United Nations System umbrella, supporting the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER), established by the UN Secretary-General on 19 September 2014 to scale up the response to the EVD outbreak.

The provision of services proved essential to support the containment of the EVD virus and halt of the outbreak. This was achieved by enabling the rapid set up of the logistics backbone; establishing logistics coordination mechanisms to provide harmonisation and information management services, ensuring the collaboration among organizations and maximizing the use of available logistics assets and resources; providing humanitarian air services to allow responders to access and move across the affected countries; setting up reliable emergency telecommunications systems.

This regional operation also supported the phasing out of UNMEER and the transfer of additional operational responsibility to WFP.

With a density of 2,756 people per square kilometer (km2) in urban areas and 843 people per km2 overall, Bangladesh is the most densely populated country in the world (excluding a few city-states).  Bangladesh is urbanizing at a rapid pace and the country's urban population is expected to reach 89.5 million (from 39.5 million in 2005) by 2030.  According to one estimate, by 2020 the urban poor figure could be as high as 40%-60% of the urban population.  Notwithstanding higher economic growth in urban areas, the absolute number of poor households is increasing in urban Bangladesh due to migration of rural poor into urban areas. Studies have shown that the health indicators of the urban poor are as worse as those of the rural poor because of poorer living conditions, and limited urban PHC. Failure to provide urban PHC can have serious negative externalities - spread of communicable diseases, debilitating epidemics, reduction in economic productivity, among others.","False","False","Transaction",,"asdb","asdb"

An overwhelming majority (96%) of the women reported that their earnings per month increased. Pre-school aged children also benefited from child-care support and basic education services offered through the project. Some 80% of staff of the partner organisation improved their project management skills.   The project worked to strengthen the overall well-being of vulnerable women, their families and their communities in Kabul and Jalalabad. The project accomplished this through providing opportunities for vulnerable women and their families to meet their education, professional training and micro-finance training needs so that they may participate autonomously in the local economy. Also the project ensured that participating women were provided with daycare support. Secondly, the project built the institutional capacity of the Afghanistan Women’s Council (AWC) so that it could, during and long after the project lifespan, fully and effectively contribute to the positive and sustainable development of Afghanistan. The project moved into a second phase in March 2011. In this phase, project activities were extended to additional neighbourhoods in Kabul and Jalalabad, in order to reach more women. The need to involve men directly in project activities was recognized during the first phase of the project.

In line with the United Nations Development Assistance Framework for Nepal, and the government's Three-Year Development Plan 2013-2016, the CP was implemented through three components and contributed to WFP Strategic Objectives 3 and 4.

The Productive Assets and Livelihoods component contributed to improve household food security and resilience. It provided seasonal employment and livelihood training that enabled rehabilitation of rural roads, irrigation channels and other community assets and acted as a safety net for rural households with low income. Through these projects, people were assisted in applying available resources in their community in more sustainable ways.

The Education Support component aligned with the government's School Sector Reform Programme, intended to provide children with an education of better quality. WFP provided school meals to pre-primary and primary schoolchildren with the purpose of keeping children in school and encouraging more children to be enrolled, both girls and boys, and improving their attendance. WFP also built school infrastructure, rehabilitated kitchens, latrines, and water stations. WFP distributed non-food items, particularly energy-saving stoves, cooking utensils and school furniture among others in an effort to assist the government in developing child-friendly schools that attract more children to study in a better learning environment. WFP worked in partnership with the Food for Education Project (FFEP) under the Ministry of Education.

The Nutrition Component provided support to the Ministry of Health and Population to prevent chronic malnutrition among pregnant and lactating women (PLW) and children aged 6 to 23 months through the Mother and Child Health and Nutrition (MCHN) programme. The specialised nutritious food ""Super Cereal"" was given to PLW and children, complemented with key messages on health, nutrition and hygiene habits. WFP also planned to support the government to treat moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) in children aged 6 to 59 months, in partnership with UNICEF under the Integrated Management of Moderate Acute Malnutrition (IMAM) programme. In addition, WFP supported a study on low birth weight in two districts which was concluded in 2015.

Capacity Development was provided across the three components, to strengthen the government's ability to implement these and similar programmes. In particular, WFP provided technical assistance and supported the institutionalisation of a national monitoring system known as the Nepal Food Security Monitoring System (NeKSAP) into government structures at the national and sub-national level. A key WFP contribution to augment the government's logistics and telecommunications capabilities was the humanitarian staging area (HSA) constructed under the Emergency Preparedness and Response (EPR) project with resources provided through a Trust Fund, in the Tribhuvan International Airport.

Ungefär 125.000 portugiser har de senaste åren migrerat till Angola, och 15.000 till Kap Verde. Den långa kön utanför Angolas konsulat i Lissabon är en tydlig signal på att en ny epok inträtt. Bakgrunden till denna utveckling är den starka makroekonomiska tillväxten i Angola och Kap Verde i kombination med den ekonomiska krisen i Portugal. Det tvingande behovet av att skaffa sig en säker inkomst delar de portugisiska migranterna med arbetskraftsmigranter över hela världen. I detta fall sammanfaller emellertid den ekonomiska utsattheten med en position av symbolisk överlägsenhet som har sina rötter i den portugisiska koloniala identiteten. Vidare har Portugal under de senaste årtiondena byggt upp utvecklingssamarbeten med de forna afrikanska kolonierna och sänt ut *experter* för att leda dessa samarbeten. Denna roll som utvecklingsexperter verkar delvis prägla de nya portugisiska migranternas syn på sig själva. Det grundläggande syftet med projektet är att undersöka de portugisiska migranternas eventuella bidrag till utveckling i Angola och Kap Verde genom överföring av socialt kapital och humankapital. Med socialt kapital avses band till transnationella sociala nätverk som kan vara av betydelse för utveckling. Humankapital handlar om migranternas kunskaper, färdigheter och erfarenheter. Projektet är fokuserat på följande forskningsfrågor: -Hur upplever de portugisiska migranterna sin integration i de afrikanska mottagarländerna och sina eventuella bidrag i form av socialt kapital och humankapital? -Hur förhandlar de portugisiska migranterna sin identitet i förhållande till de angolaner / kapverdier de möter i arbetslivet, och hur förstår och hanterar migranterna de förändrade maktförhållandena? -Hur ser angolaner / kapverdier som arbetar med de portugisiska migranterna på a) migranternas bidrag i form av socialt kapital och humankapital, b) deras förändrade identitet och maktposition, c) deras integration. I relation till specifika forskningsfält anknyter projektet till migrations- och utvecklingsstudier i kombination med en postkolonial ansats. Inom migrationsstudier finns det en mycket omfattande forskning kring arbetskrafts- / ekonomisk migration från utvecklingsländer till Europa, men ingenting är publicerat om migration i den motsatta riktningen. Beträffande samband mellan migration och utveckling är existerande forskning helt fokuserad på hur migranter från utvecklingsländer kan bidra till utveckling i sina ursprungsländer. Samtida europeisk arbetskraftsmigration till Afrika är ett outforskat tema, liksom frågor kring vad denna typ av migration kan bidra med i termer av överföring av socialt kapital och humankapital. Projektet pågår i tre år och fokuserar på migranter i Benguela (Angola) och Mindelo (Kap Verde). De viktigaste metoderna för materialinsamling är deltagande observation och intervjuer. Deltagande observation genomförs på klubbar och i andra sociala sammanhang där portugisiska migranterna möts, samt i deras hem och på deras arbetsplatser. För intervjuer görs ett urval av 30-40 migranter i vardera Angola och Kap Verde och dessa intervjuas vid upprepade tillfällen 2014-2016. Intervjuerna fokuserar på 1. migranternas syn på vilka nya former av socialt kapital och humankapital som de eventuellt bidrar med, 2. migranternas syn på de viktigaste sociala och kulturella skillnaderna mellan Portugal och Angola / Kap Verde och på hur de själva förhåller sig till dessa, 3 migranternas syn på sin identitet och på sin situation som arbetskraftsmigranter i de forna kolonierna. Projektet intervjuar också migranternas arbetskamrater om deras syn på portugisernas roll i förhållande till den utveckling som äger rum i Angola / Kap Verde och om de skiftande maktrelationerna mellan dem själva och portugiserna.

This IM requires the MoH to provide a significant counter-part at the start by covering costs of the MoH staff and providing health services.  Some costs will be incurred only when new activities start. Ongoing costs, such as laboratory reagents, will be progressively assumed by the MoH and included in the National Social Security System.

However original design envisaged full equipment of all forestry units in the project area (including patrol cars, tractors etc.) which is now not necessary as Government has been improving and will continue to improve material resources of the forestry units barring any unexpected severe financial and budgetary crisis. Reduction in forestry related civil works in the part A of the project is possible due to less expensive project support of planting activities performed with Borrower's own funds.

It contributed to the key operational objectives of reducing poverty, enhancing food security and nutrition, and reducing vulnerability to recurrent shocks, thus contributing to WFP's Strategic Objectives 3 and 4. This was done through four main components:

Component 1, Improving Maternal and Child Nutrition (IMCN), aims to break the inter-generational cycle of undernutrition in Bangladesh. Following national guidelines and corporate strategies, WFP implements a targeted supplementary feeding programme (TSFP) for the treatment of moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) and provides children aged 6-59 months with Super Cereal Plus (WSB++) and pregnant and lactating women (PLW) with a premix of Super Cereal (WSB+) and fortified vegetable oil. TSFP is accompanied by behavior change communication (BCC) activities on nutrition and hygiene, thus combining treatment and prevention measures. Blanket supplementary feeding programme (BSFP) for the undocumented refugees from Myanmar was also planned for children (Super Cereal Plus) and PLW (Super Cereal and fortified vegetable oil) as explained in the beneficiaries, targeting and distribution section.

Component 2, School Feeding, aims to contribute to the Government of Bangladesh's overall goal of achieving universal primary education by increasing enrolment and attendance of pre-primary and primary schoolchildren through distributing nutritious biscuits and essential learning packages, and by providing technical support to the government. The School Meals Initiative, launched in 2013 in collaboration with the government to test an alternative modality, provides cooked meals to schoolchildren. Through the McGovern-Dole contribution, a literacy component is integrated into the programme.

Component 3, Enhancing Resilience to Natural Disasters and the Effects of Climate Change (ER), aims to enhance the resilience and food security of vulnerable communities and households through the creation of community assets. It focuses on achieving four key aspects: physical and environmental resilience, social resilience, economic resilience, and capacity enhancement of ultra-poor women and men and their families. Participants work to construct or repair community assets and take part in comprehensive training sessions; in return they receive cash. Particularly vulnerable woman participants benefit from a one-off cash grant for investment in income-generating activities, a monthly living allowance and follow-up support. The government directly funds 95 percent of the participants and WFP provides technical support to help enhance the quality of services.

Component 4, Strengthening Government Safety Nets (SGSN), aims to help the government enhance social safety nets addressing hunger and household food insecurity by providing technical assistance to the Vulnerable Group Development (VGD) programme and by implementing a promotional safety net in Cox's Bazar district titled Enhancing Food Security and Nutrition (EFSN) as well as an operational research project titled Targeting the Ultra Poor-Nutrition (TUP-N). The latter is a research initiative that sets out to examine if child stunting can be prevented by delivering a livelihoods support programme to ultra-poor women with small children.

In 2012, WFP phased out of direct implementation of food aid and redirected its partnership toward pure technical assistance and capacity development to contribute to the country's efforts to achieve the goal of zero hunger.

Initially, the current country programme (2008 to 2014) in India focused on reducing food insecurity and malnutrition through the introduction of innovative nutritional food options suitable for consumption by different vulnerable groups and at various physiological stages of life cycle such as pregnancy, such as children under 2 years of age or people living with HIV and tribal populations. From mid-2012 onwards, the emphasis gradually moved to providing technical assistance to government programmes through an active role in policy advocacy, with the objective of eventually increasing the operational efficiency and nutritional effectiveness of India's vast ongoing safety net programmes to reach the targeted vulnerable population. The shift in WFP's objectives was in line with government priorities and the lower middle-income country status of India. 

In 2014, WFP continued to support the strengthening of government capacity in the planning and implementation of food safety net schemes. Primarily, WFP's efforts revolved around TPDS reforms for improved beneficiary coverage, leakage reduction and responsive systems, with a focus on targeting, supply chain efficiency, effective grievance redressal and operational viability at the ground level. Activities also included research on the TPDS food basket and on devising strategies for improving its nutritional content. These improvements could potentially impact more than 800 million people in India, who are covered by the public distribution system but currently not receiving optimal benefits due to inefficiencies in the system.

In rural parts of West Africa prone to drought, many young men and women move away because they lack decent job opportunities. Understanding more about labour markets in rural areas can help improve rural living standards. But that is only one side of the problem: equally important is research on the activities youth engage in when they move to cities, and on how labour markets work in the urban setting. This project will examine these issues as they affect both male and female youth.

One of the project's main goals is to develop profiles of the different experiences young men and women have in both rural and urban environments. As well, researchers aim to study the impact of out-migration on the rural economy, with a focus on its impact on women in the countryside and on land tenure issues.

Led by the Initiative Prospective Agricole et Rurale in Senegal and the Centre d'Études, de Documentation et de Recherches Économiques et Sociales in Burkina Faso, this project will analyze rural labour markets in both countries. Researchers will also investigate what drives productivity in the informal economy that youth often become part of when they move to cities. 

Researchers will produce analyses for each country using advanced survey tools and secondary data. These reports will give policymakers options on how to improve the way rural labour markets function. Having new policy options may also feed into development of small-scale urban activities with better potential than those that currently exist.

The project is designed to use the findings of its applied research to influence national and regional policy affecting the African rice industry to ensure that agricultural policy considers the needs of all rice agricultural stakeholders, especially local farmers.   Rice is the most rapidly growing source of food in Africa. Both urban and rural populations have come to depend on it as a food staple that is easy to prepare, store and provides a high source of calories, making it an essential complement to good nutrition. In 2010, Africans consumed an estimated 26 million tons of rice, with an average per capita consumption rate of 24 kg per year.

To compensate for this, it was agreed to reduce the purchase of the equipment as Borrower financing for hardware purchase and planting programs has significantly improved. The project still plans to purchase the very essential equipment for planting and fire fighting needs (11 mln USD). However original design envisaged full equipment of all forestry units in the project area (including patrol cars, tractors etc.) which is now not necessary as Government has been improving and will continue to improve material resources of the forestry units barring any unexpected severe financial and budgetary crisis. Reduction in forestry related civil works in the part A of the project is possible due to less expensive project support of planting activities performed with Borrower's own funds. The project will do more site preparation and experimental planting. Planting targets are still achievable due to Borrower's budgetary financing.","False","False","Budget",1,"worldbank","ida"

Being more vulnerable to external shocks, Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in developing countries have been finding it difficult to sustain operations due to the global financial crisis and the quality of their jobs is being compromised in the process. The large majority of employment for both women and men is found in SMEs and the key to sustainable economic development that leads to effective poverty reduction lies in competitive and growing SMEs. Current research is showing that innovations in work organization, continuous workplace learning, good labour-management relations, and respect for workers’ rights are important ways of raising productivity while also promoting decent work. The broad problem that this project will address is how to minimize the impact of the financial crisis by fostering responsible and thus sustainable workplace practices – economic, social and environmental – in SMEs in order to improve their productivity and competitiveness in a manner that contributes to sustainable economic development. 2. The development objective of SCORE is that SMEs are more sustainable through being cleaner, more productive and competitive and provide more sustainable and decent employment. To achieve this, the project is expected to have achieved the following concrete outcomes by the end of the two year project: a) Industry associations can market and coordinate enterprise upgrading services to their local members. b) Service providers can effectively deliver training and advisory services for workplace upgrading on a commercially sustainable basis. c) Labour inspectorate services work with mass media to disseminate progressive workplace practices. 3. SCORE will be implemented in six countries, Colombia, Ghana, South Africa, Indonesia, India and China. The approach of the project is to, on the micro level through service providers provide training, counselling to upgrade enterprise competitiveness through good workplace practices; on the meso-level build the capacity among service providers and associations to deliver commercially viable upgrading services, on the macro level demonstrate that the approach is replicable on a national scale to other sectors and locations and on the meta level, finally, through mass media influence the behaviour of enterprise level practices. The project will work in sectors with high potential for employment creation. Focus will be on capacity building at the meso level rather than direct subsidies of enterprise training. A global component will coordinate the project and be responsible for knowledge sharing, global advocacy and introduction of the programme in new countries. 4. Each country will implement the programme in minimum one sub sector and at least two clusters targeting 10-15 enterprises in each cluster. Some countries such as India and China are expected to go substantially beyond this outreach level as a result of prior pilot projects. Based on the historic performance of SCORE’s predecessor the Factory Improvement Programme, FIP, the following overall impact is expected in participating enterprises: ¿ Business growth as a result of improved competitiveness and better access to markets ¿ Overall improvement in the culture of worker-management collaboration leading to continuous improvement as well as reduced labour absenteeism and turnover ¿ Improved quality in terms of reduced defects and improved on time delivery ¿ Improved productivity through better environmental management (reduced waste and energy consumption) and better workplace management (reduced labour accidents and sick leave) 5. The project supports the local DWCP in each country. It will work with UNIDO to revise and implement the capacity building interventions on productivity and environmental management.

This grant will allow GINI to organize a 2-day workshop in Singapore, 8-9 August 2010, which will engage senior fiscal economists and planners from the region and abroad. They will explore specific research questions in the areas of political economy of tax regimes, recent and upcoming fiscal reforms, and fiscal federalism and decentralization. It is expected to result in a proposal for a multi-country collaborative research program on fiscal policy and tax systems.

This reliance is unsustainable. As governments are facing increased pressure to move to greener modes of production, consumption is increasing. Both issues present new challenges to developing countries. This project will look at how small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) will manage this transformation.

SMEs are responsible for the largest share of jobs in developing countries. An environmental, or greening, approach to production can put SMEs and jobs at risk. However, new industries and productive sectors may emerge too, generating new jobs. Though there is growing knowledge about the implications of going green, reliable analysis and data are limited. There are also opposing views on the likely impact going green will have on employment, and SME competitiveness and survival.

This project will carry out applied research on the challenge and opportunities that going green offer to SMEs in Peru and Argentina. Specifically, it will aim to generate findings on the main impacts of better environmental practices on employment, labour conditions, productivity, performance, and the creation of new green markets in Buenos Aires and Lima.

Researchers will analyze firms' greening experiences in both locales using surveys, interviews, and case studies. Their findings will:
-generate new knowledge about different models of sustainable practices; 
-assess the impact of going green on employment and productivity for firms participating in clean production programs;
-provide evidence of whether or not new green markets develop out of the greening process; and, 
-promote a policy debate on alternative models of greener practices in SMEs.

The research will also shed light on the role of public policies in fostering or impeding the adoption of green business practices. It will help promote policy debates on alternative models of environmental transformation in SMEs, taking their expected impacts on employment and development into account.","False","False","Transaction",,"idrccrdi","CA"

nutrition insecurity, poverty and vulnerability to the effects of climate change is rising
steadily. The 2005 and 2010 severe food and nutrition crises affected more than 10 million
people in the region. In 2012, the combined effect of a decrease in grain production and an
increase in prices aggravated food and nutrition insecurity for more than 16 million people in
countries of the Sahel. Similarly, the livestock situation in countries of the Sahel remains
difficult due to poor pasture development, lack of water points and overgrazing resulting in
early transhumance and changes in livestock movement routes, exacerbating inter-community
and border tensions.
A lasting solution to food and nutrition insecurity in the Sahel requires building resilience to
climate change, long-term agricultural sector financing and developing trade and regional
integration. By making sustained longer term investments in household resilience, the cost of
emergency assistance will be significantly reduced and, ultimately, the cycle of recurring
famine will be broken. This is the most cost-effective intervention option which meets the
basic needs and preserves the dignity of the populations of the Sahel. It is within this
framework that the Programme to Build Resilience to Food and Nutrition Insecurity in the
Sahel (P2RS) was designed.  The programme?s sector objective is to contribute to reducing
poverty and improving food and nutrition security in the Sahel. Its specific objective is to
increase, on a sustainable basis, agro-sylvo-pastoral and fishery productivity and production
in the Sahel. The programme will be implemented through four projects each implemented
over a five-year period in three components, namely: (i) Rural Infrastructure Development;
(ii) Value Chains and Regional Markets Development; and (iii) Project Management. pauvreté et à l'amélioration de la sécurité alimentaire et nutritionnelle au Sahel. Son objectif spécifique  est d'accroître, sur P2RS Project 1 will be implemented in seven countries (Burkina Faso, Chad,

fishermen (180 000 farms and SMEs targeted). Special attention will be paid to women and
children of tender age, specifically those within the period of 1 000 days from pregnancy to

First, while the additional financing for the project (Ln. 7732-BR) was approved in August 2009, loan effectiveness was delayed by seventeen months (January 24, 2011), due to conditions at the Federal level beyond the control of the State of Bahia. Second, the reduced effective implementation period of 2.5 years has proved to be insufficient to complete the investment cycle for many community subprojects financed under the loan. Third, while the loan is fully disbursed, subproject implementation has lagged, largely due to the protracted Effectiveness delay. The community subproject cycle, from transfer of funds to the community association's account until implementation is complete and the expenditures are verify, is a period of 9-12 months.

This program of research on adaptation to climate change represents a joint investment of $70 million over seven years in Asia and Africa. The program aims to develop robust evidence to inform policies and practices capable of increasing the resilience of vulnerable populations. Its geographic focus consists of ""hot spots"" in Africa and Asia: semi-arid zones, mega-deltas and densely populated river basins (including glacier-fed systems). These hot spots combine two factors: significant impacts in the biophysical environment from climate change, and high risks to the livelihood of a large number of poor people with limited capacity to adapt.

Using different socio-economic scenarios and climate warming scenarios, researchers will develop a better understanding of the conditions that make poor people vulnerable to climate change. As well, researchers will identify sustainable adaptation measures that can be promoted within and across the hot spots. Research findings will provide decision-makers at the local, national and regional levels with robust scientific evidence needed to policies and programs capable of increasing the resilience of vulnerable populations to climate change.

WFP provided food assistance to newly-arrived Colombian refugees and asylum seekers to ensure that their immediate food needs were met. Additionally, recovery-related actions assisting both Colombian refugees and Ecuadorian host communities were implemented in areas where integration remains difficult. The operation paid particular attention to the needs of women by promoting gender equality and women's empowerment, and to protection issues by implementing actions to reduce tensions among all vulnerable groups.

In all activities, WFP's main objective is to increase diet diversity and change unhealthy eating habits through improved awareness and understanding of what constitutes good nutrition, by conditioning food assistance to the attendance of trainings and limiting the redemption of vouchers to healthy and nutritious products. The project's recovery component included support to school-based activities, trainings on production and marketing of nutritious foods, as well as on watersheds protection, under the food assistance-for-assets modality. Furthermore, local production was promoted by linking small-scale farmers' organizations to school-centered activities and to food assistance for refugees, and by strengthening capacities of farmers and local governments in supply chain management, including food quality control, production and marketing.

Capacity development and cost sharing for the school feeding activities with local governments were key elements of the operation.

In a crisis, it can force households to cut consumption, take out usurious loans or deplete business income. Access to financial services plays a critical role in helping the poor broaden their economic opportunities, increase their asset base and reduce their vulnerability to external shocks. Many Latin Americans have little access to formal financial services. In Peru, for example, less than 1% of households in extreme poverty have savings accounts.
Over the past 10 years, conditional cash transfers (CCT) to families have been implemented on a large scale. There have been some experiments linking a financial inclusion component to CCT programs, either by opening savings accounts in which to deposit the transfer or through specific savings promotion programs targeting social transfer recipients.
Through a series of calls for proposals, this project will examine whether social protection policies can serve as a tool for economic empowerment via the use of financial services such as deposits, credit and microinsurance. It will also look at the role of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in providing such services.

Changes to the PDO and the results framework are needed to reflect investment priorities of participating cities focusing on water and wastewater services.

Institutional strengthening and integrated planning at the national level, the provincial level (in East New Britain and Milne Bay), and the local level (in Kokopo, Rabaul and Alotau), will enable entities to carry out key priorities such as: improved destination planning and management; marketing and promotion; skilled workforce development and capacity building; product development; sustainable site management of tourism assets; and performance monitoring and evaluation activities. Support will ensure that all planning, design, implementation and monitoring activities are done in an inclusive and gender-sensitive manner. The second component is the infrastructure and community/product development. This component will support the development of integrated tourism destinations in Milne Bay and East New Britain, as identified in the provincial tourism strategies. The implementation of the vision laid out in the tourism strategies will require small-scale/site-specific improvements or rehabilitations that do not affect areas broader than the sites, and direct support to community led enterprises. Finally, the third component is the project management.

The additional financing does not propose to pursue the diversification of generation agenda for two reasons: (i) private sector interest in wind, solar, and geothermal investments exists and can better be supported through other avenues (the Bank is already engaged with the Government of Djibouti in a dialogue on how best to mobilize investments for geothermal development); and (ii) EDD's current level of electricity losses will offset the bulk of benefits that could be obtained today from small scale diversification.

Initially, the operation aimed to support around 300,000 internally displaced Malians and around 255,000 refugees crossing borders into neighbouring Burkina Faso, Mauritania and Niger. Four budget revisions led to an adjustment of refugee numbers and the transition of internally displaced Malians to the Mali single country EMOP. Only refugees assisted in the three neighbouring countries stayed under the regional emergency operation, assisting 145,000 refugees overall. Burkina Faso considerably reduced its refugee numbers by shifting their focus to assisting refugees settled in official camps and not unofficial sites, and by using biometric registration provided by UNHCR to verify refugee lists. In Mauritania and Niger, refugee numbers remained stable, but towards the end of 2014, Niger stopped providing assistance to Nigerien returnees as they were meant to return to their places of origin, and only refugees received continuous assistance.

Security in northern Mali deteriorated further during 2014. Inter-Malian peace talks in Algiers convened intermittently from August to November 2014. Attacks targeting the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) and aid workers increased. Since September 2013, 31 peacekeepers have been killed and 90 wounded. In 2015 attacks continued increasing as armed groups aimed to strengthen claims for territorial autonomy by consolidating control over strategic areas ahead of and during negotiations. Reprisals against returning refugees prohibited largescale returns.

The main objectives of the EMOP are to:
(i) Support the food security of Malian refugees in Burkina Faso, Mauritania and Niger through general food distributions (GFD) using food, cash and/or voucher modalities.
(ii) Prevent and treat moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) among children aged 6-59 months and pregnant and lactating women (PLW) through blanket supplementary feeding (BSF) and targeted supplementary feeding (TSF).
(iii) Support emergency school feeding activities for refugees.

The regional EMOP's nutrition activities were aligned with and complemented WFP's Regional Response Framework for the Sahel drought. The emergency operation was aligned to WFP Strategic Objective 1 ""Save lives and protect livelihoods in emergencies"" and contributed toward Millennium Development Goals 1 ""Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger"", 4 ""Reduce child mortality"" and 5 ""Improve maternal health.""

The EMOP was modified twice in 2015: in January, to extend its duration for twelve months, from 1 January to 31 December 2015, to accommodate continuing needs of Malian refugees (budget revision 7); and in October 2015, to include additional needs that resulted from the delays in the deactivation process (budget revision 8).

In 2014, the PRRO activities consisted of: (i) General food distributions (GFD) to the most vulnerable refugees, (ii) Targeted Supplementary Feeding (TSF) for children aged 6-59 months with moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) and pregnant and lactating women (PLW) in the refugees' camp in Kouankan and the (iii) capacity development for national institutions to enable them to respond timely and efficiently to food security issues in emergencies situation. Due to a lack of funding, no HIV/TB activities were implemented in 2014.

A budget revision from January 2014 allowed WFP to continue addressing basic food and nutrition needs of Ivorian refugees and their families, providing targeted relief and recovery assistance to people affected by inter-ethnic violence in the Forest Guinea region, and to people affected by flooding in Kankan Macenta and Siguiri prefectures while a new PRRO was under formulation with a proposed start in April 2014.","False","False","Budget",2,"wfp","wfp"

CARIAA is supporting a network of four high-capacity consortia to conduct research and policy engagement that will help build the poor's resilience to climate change. The program will run until 2019 and focuses on three climate change hot spots in Africa and Asia:
-semi-arid regions of Africa and South and Central Asia
-large deltas of Africa and South Asia 
-Himalayan river basins

The program will generate and share new knowledge on vulnerability, adaptation, and resilience within hotspots. It will also strengthen adaptation and resilience building expertise among researchers, policymakers, and practitioners. In doing so, the program will ensure better ways to inform policy and practice. IDRC and the UK Department for International Development jointly fund the initiative.

To achieve these ambitious objectives, the four CARIAA consortia have developed comprehensive work plans with intra-consortium and cross-consortium activities. 

Annual learning reviews
The CARIAA team will support this commitment to program-level learning and knowledge sharing by organizing annual learning reviews where consortia can share key findings. CARIAA will also provide funding for research outputs that are based on synthesizing results that emerge through this process. 

This funding will allow CARIAA to organize and implement the first annual CARIAA Learning Review during the 9th International Conference on Community-Based Adaptation. The learning review will focus on developing a common strategy to ensure research findings can influence policy and practice, a key challenge faced by each consortium and the program as a whole.

The project concentrates on key areas important to local governments’ ability to provide an efficient and attractive operating environment for both large and small-scale businesses. Up to 15 demonstration projects are undertaken in selected local governments of the seven target countries. Up to three local governments are involved in each demonstration project for a total of up to 45 local governments directly benefitting from the program. These projects focus on: (a) local economic governance, including political leadership (men, women and youth leaders), business development advocacy, local economic development planning, and business and community engagement; (b) municipal services to businesses; and (c) revenue generation, and access to financing. The demonstration projects aim to create positive changes in the local governments involved. They also help the LGAs to exemplify or advocate for policy and legislative changes, and to provide examples of best practices to be disseminated to other local governments in the country and the region.

Also, the outbreak of Ebola Virus Disease in neighboring countries (Liberia and Guinea) significantly affected the food security situation in the villages located in the west, along the border with the Ebola-affected countries. The preventive measures (closure of border, ban in consumption of wild meat and hunting) implemented by Ivorian local authorities disrupted the livelihoods in the western regions and limited the populations' capabilities to conduct their regular income generating activities.  

The Protracted Relief and Recovery Operation 200464 (PRRO) provided food assistance through the following activities: (i) general food distribution (GFD) to returnees and vulnerable local populations, including those living in villages along the border; (ii) treatment of moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) among children aged 6-59 months and pregnant and lactating women (PLW); (iii) food-by-prescription (FbP) and cash transfers for malnourished clients under anti-retroviral treatment (ART); (iv) social protection support for orphans and other vulnerable children; and (v) food assistance for assets (FFA).

Based on lessons drawn from these emergencies, WFP established the Aviation Global Emergency Response project in 2011 to ensure that standby helicopters would be readily available for timely emergency interventions in a cost-efficient manner. When not on emergency deployment, the helicopters were available to perform dedicated services for individual organizations upon request and on a cost-recovery basis.

UNESCO har skickat en ansökan om stöd till Sida för organisationens arbete med utbildning (ED), kommunikation och information (CI), kultur (CLT) och forskning (SC). Sida DEMO har i bifogad bedömningspromemoria tagit ställning till ansökan om stöd till Cl- och CLT-sektorerna. Det är önskvärt att eventuellt stöd från GLOBPRO, FORSK och DEMO inkluderas inom ett och samma Programme Cooperation Agreement (PCA) med UNESCO i enlighet med bifogat avtalsutkast. 

DEMOs förslag till stöd till CI och CLT avser i första hand ett tematiskt stöd till de föreslagna programmen inom CI och CLT, där huvudfokus inom CI-programmet ligger på främjande av yttrandefrihet och medieutveckling och huvudfokus inom CLT-programmet ligger på främjande av yttrandefrihet genom stärkande av policys för främjande av kulturell mångfald. 

De föreslagna programmen är väl förankrade i UNESCO Medium-Term Strategy för 2014-2021 (37 C/4) och Programme and Budget för 2014-2017 (37 C/5). Verksamheten är både global och landspecifik, där globala komponenter i huvudsak är normativt orienterade och komponenter på landnivå fokuserar på kapacitetsutveckling, allt emedan det finns ett sampel mellan det globala och landspecifika arbetet. I fokus för verksamhet på landnivå är länder som präglas av ett demokratisk underskott, inklusive inskränkningar inom yttrandefrihet och brist på oberoende media. 

Globalt normativt inom yttrandefrihet och medieutveckling bidrar CI-programmet i huvudsak till områdena säkerhet för journalister, yttrandefrihet online och offline, media literacy samt media och jämställdhet. På landnivå bidrar programmet till UNESCOs arbete med lokal radio i Afrika samt andra landspecifika yttrandefrihetsinsatser i Afrika, MENA och Latinamerika inom lagstifnings- och påverkansarbete samt kapacitetsbyggande insatser inom ICT, media och journalistik, vilket är ett viktigt bidrag till att stärka demokratisering och yttrandefrihet i dessa länder. CLT-programmet är starkt förankrat i 2005 års UNESCO konvention för kulturell mångfald som har yttrandefrihet och jämställdhet som grundläggande principer. Kapacitetsutveckling på landnivå fokuserar på förståelse av konventionen och metoder för datainsamlig och uppföljning av konventionen, vilket bl a inkludrerar bevakning av yttrandefrihet/kommunikation. Det globala normativa arbetet fokuserar på att dokumentera och formulera policys, standards och regleringar inom området. 

Sverige kommer att stödja UNESCOs arbete för yttrandefrihet under en fyraårsperiod med 80,5 miljoner SEK, med en första utbetalning 2014, som är det första året för UNESCO med dess nya strategiska plan, program och budget. UNESCOs ansökan bygger på en programperiod om fyra år. I och med att programmet start infaller senare än planerat år 2014 så kommer programmets aktivtetsperiod att löpa till och med 30 juni 2018. 

Utbetalningsplanen fördelad på delkomponenter i Plus ser ut som följande: 
Pluskomponent 6107800001 Communication/Empowering Local Radios for ICT: 
2014 SEK 735 000; 2015 SEK 10 000 000; 2016 SEK 10 000 000; 2017 SEK 9 000 000 
Pluskomponent 6107800002 Communication/Support to Democracy and Freedom of Expression: 
2014 6 104 000; 2015 SEK 3 702 000; 2016 SEK 10 396 000; 2017 SEK 11 515 000

Questions surrounding Tunisia's post-revolution transformation have centered on how to help the country make policy choices and undertake the reforms needed to respond to the revolution's objectives related to equity, youth inclusiveness, deprived regions, and access to quality jobs for young men and women. While this is a positive sign of the democratic transition, it has also demonstrated the lack of evidence-based debate, despite the existence of a strong cadre of researchers and economists. The absence of credible and independent economic policy centres or think tanks leaves a large gap in policy debates.

It can be caused by development projects, conflict, or natural disasters. It is a traumatic process because it can involve loss of housing, income, livelihoods, assets, and access to natural resources. This research project will examine the interplay between involuntary displacement, violence, inequality, and poverty on re-settled populations living in urban communities.

The project will seek to identify and, where possible, quantify the links between the violence of forced displacement and the level of poverty and inequality. Researchers will investigate these linkages in two cities in Sri Lanka (Colombo and Jaffna) and one city in India (Cochin) where urban displacement and resettlement are significant issues.

There is limited information on how displaced people cope with the risks associated with accommodation, eviction, nutrition, the basic needs of women and children, legal status, and protection at urban locations. The lack of context-based household survey data has hindered the process of:
- counting the numbers of those affected;
- planning strategies to help them; and, 
- creating evidence-based interventions. 

South Asia has little in the way of studies on the violence, urbanization, and inequality experienced by displaced people in urban contexts. The state, private sector, and international aid agencies have been unable to cope with the massive influx of displaced people into cities. It is therefore essential to develop evidence-based strategies to help those trying to rebuild their lives.

This study will target returned, resettled, and relocated people following development-induced or conflict-induced displacement. It will look at their urban host communities which have been mostly spared from displacement. Researchers will conduct an extensive literature review. They will also conduct a quantitative and qualitative survey to document the impact of violence on settlers in the fragile post-war reality of Sri Lanka and the relatively stable reality of Cochin, India.

This project is part of the Safe and Inclusive Cities (SAIC) research initiative designed to build an evidence base on the connections between urban violence, poverty, and inequalities. Jointly funded by IDRC and the United Kingdom's Department for International Development, the SAIC program also seeks to identify the most effective strategies for addressing these challenges in Latin America and the Caribbean, South Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa.

Le premier volet  a fait l’objet d’une formulation séparée en 2010 pour 7 MEUR (PADK 2). Les 7 MEUR restants étaient à l’époque réservés pour un appui budgétaire sectoriel. Cependant, le secteur ne rencontrant pas les critères d’éligibilité, il a été décidé au CSP d’octobre 2010 d’organiser la mise en œuvre de cette enveloppe sous la forme d’un « projet d’appui financier ». La modalité choisie en juin 2011 a été l’exécution nationale. Le CCQ du 27.10.2011 a donné un avis favorable.

Despite increased openness to evidence-based policymaking, local funding for Latin American policy research institutions is extremely limited and often partisan. Except in Peru (and universities in general), policy research organizations are relatively young and face challenges common to newly established institutions anywhere: difficulties in establishing a focused research agenda, problems in attracting and retaining staff and governance issues.

This grant will strengthen the ability of the 12 selected research institutions to provide, disseminate and communicate high-quality research. This will be achieved through measures aimed at enhancing the ability of staff to conduct sound research, improving organizational governance, and communicating with policymakers. Particular effort will be made to enable grantees to mobilize other sources of funding, so that none become dependent on the Think Tank Initiative over the long term. The project will also support a platform for grantee networking both within the Initiative and with a wider network of institutions engaged in policy-related research.

Cada 15 días venía el médico del pueblo y sobre todo las mujeres, se agolpaban a las puertas de dicho centro donde solo la habitación del médico tenía una mesa. Sin equipamiento, sin infraestructuras adecuadas, la Asociación Darsilame solicitó un proyecto de codesarrollo a la DPZ en el año 2013 para la rehabilitación del centro médico, proyecto que fue aprobado. El Ministerio de Salud al conocer la noticia de la financiación, solicitó que se hicieran obras de ampliación del centro, encargándose ellos de los planos y los permisos necesarios. De esta forma, se solicitó a la DPZ, lo que fue aceptado. Actualmente, el centro está casi terminado, se está colocando el techo del mismo, una vez terminadas las obras de albañilería. Debido a que en la época de lluvias se hace casi imposible avanzar, la obra lleva un cierto retraso, pero ya en unas semanas estará terminada gracias a la colaboración del pueblo.

We Effects vision är en hållbar och rättvis värld fri från fattigdom och organisationen arbetar inom landsbygdsutveckling och bostäder, inkluderat rätten till mark, jämställdhet och finansiella tjänster. Ansökan omfattar 17 program på regional eller landnivå och ett globalt program som totalt består av 160 projekt i 24 länder. 

Sida beslutade 2014 att förnya We Effects status som ramorganisation. 

Ansökan:

Ansökan bygger på We Effects prioriteringar och följer logiskt på tidigare verksamhet. We Effects ramansökan för 2017 är en fortsättning på det ramprogram som genomförs under pågående ramavtal 2014-2016.

Syftet med stödet är att stärka partnerorganisationen som sådan och att detta i sin tur ökar organisationens förmåga att å ena sidan påverka och kräva förändring på makronivå/strukturell nivå och, å andra sidan erbjuda medlemmarna efterfrågade tjänster. Enligt We Effects förändringsteori genomförs den huvudsakliga verksamheten av partnerorganisationerna. Inom programmen för landsbygdsutveckling stödjer We Effect bondeorganisationer i deras arbete med att öka sina medlemmars inkomster och tillgång till mat genom t.ex. jordbruksrådgivning, stärkt position på marknaden och hjälp med förhandlingar om priser. Organisationen förespråkar ett hållbart och klimatanpassat jordbruk och stödjer också lokala spar- och kreditföreningar som gör det möjligt för lantbrukare med små resurser att spara och låna pengar samt få tillgång till försäkringar. Inom bostadsprogrammen arbetar We Effect med lokala bostadskooperativ där medlemmarna tillsammans bygger sina bostäder. Kooperativen bedriver påverkansarbete för tillgång till bostadskrediter och säkrad rätt till mark att bygga på. Jämställdhet är ett prioriterat område för We Effects verksamhet. We Effect strävar efter att integrera jämställdhet i all verksamhet och organisationen stödjer partnerorganisationernas arbete med att stärka kvinnors rättigheter, bland annat genom kvinnligt ledarskap, en mer rättvis arbetsfördelning i jordbruket samt genom att försvara kvinnors rätt till mark. 

Målgruppen för We Effects utvecklingssamarbete är kvinnor och män som lever i fattigdom och som är medlemmar, eller potentiella medlemmar, i kooperativa organisationer, andra demokratiska föreningar eller informella grupper vilka arbetar för att uppnå gemensamma mål.

Förväntade resultat:

We Effects ansökan har resultatmatriser på land- och regional nivå, med indikatorer och utgångsvärden. På global nivå finns en resultatmatris men utan aggregerade utgångs- och målvärden. Ansökan har följande mål:

It is expected that the restructuring will streamline and clarify responsibilities of sector ministries, and provide resources to ease transportation difficulties to enhance the delivery of agricultural and social services. No other changes are to be made to the project's activities, procurement, and financial management and safeguard arrangements. The changes have been necessitated by: (i) prolonged unsatisfactory implementation performance by the executing agencies; (ii) excessively slow disbursement compared to initial projections; (iii) difficulties in getting contracts and acquisitions underway; and (iv) the need to scale up feeder roads construction to catalyze the delivery of social services, boost agricultural production and the rural economy. The restructuring was identified during the November 19-21, 2008 implementation support mission.

The PRRO aimed to address chronic food insecurity in the Kyrgyz Republic and enable recovery for the most vulnerable, food-insecure households who were affected by weather-related threats and economic challenges. The operation focused on enabling communities with depleted assets to restore productive capacity and protect livelihoods. In 2014, this was addressed mostly through food assistance for assets (FFA). The PRRO also sought to strengthen national capacity to assess, monitor, plan and respond to food security challenges.

WFP's operation was designed to transition from the previous emergency operation, which responded to conflict and winter emergency food assistance, to recovery and development-focused interventions. PRRO 200036 aimed to build capacity and improve the long-term food security of poor, vulnerable households in the Kyrgyz Republic.

An emergency electricity infrastructure investment program has been identified to quickly address, over the next twelve months, the main risks of power system failure and lack of supply diversification, and alleviate some of the immediate effects of the global financial crisis on the country's fragile post-conflict economic growth. The project is fully aligned with and complimentary to the IDA financed Multi-Sectoral Water and Electricity Infrastructure Program (MSWEIP) and the African Development Bank (AfDB) Energy Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Extension Project, which finances investments in the electricity and water supply and distribution systems as well as a comprehensive capacity building program for REGIDESO and the Ministry of Water, Energy and Mines (MWEM).","False","False","Budget",1,"worldbank","ida"
