WFP's approach to nutrition takes into consideration the results of the SMART and EFSA assessments that took place in 2015, which demonstrated that the nutritional status of already vulnerable groups is further exacerbated by factors such as infectious diseases, parasitic disorders and food insecurity, especially among children. WFP has also been working to provide food assistance to malnourished clients on ART and TB clients to improve treatment adherence and has continued to shape its nutrition assistance in such a way that it addresses acute and chronic under nutrition through both the treatment of Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM) and the prevention of acute malnutrition, micronutrient deficiencies and chronic malnutrition; as well as facilitating a coherent coordination of nutrition interventions that are in place, in part facilitated by the REACH and SUN.

LBP also requested to: a) utilize additional funds generated from the appreciation of the Japanese yen against the Philippine peso since loan approval in 2006, and b) reallocation of loan proceeds from Part 2 (capacity development) to Part 1 (subproject investment) to fund additional sub-projects in the pipeline. A supervision mission was carried out in February 2012 to review the request, including the implementation schedule, implementation arrangements, and reallocation of project resources across categories, and revised disbursement targets during the extension period.

The program aims to develop robust evidence to inform policies and practices capable of increasing the resilience of vulnerable populations. Its geographic focus consists of ""hot spots"" in Africa and Asia: semi-arid zones, mega-deltas and densely populated river basins (including glacier-fed systems). These hot spots combine two factors: significant impacts in the biophysical environment from climate change, and high risks to the livelihood of a large number of poor people with limited capacity to adapt.

Using different socio-economic scenarios and climate warming scenarios, researchers will develop a better understanding of the conditions that make poor people vulnerable to climate change. As well, researchers will identify sustainable adaptation measures that can be promoted within and across the hot spots. Research findings will provide decision-makers at the local, national and regional levels with robust scientific evidence needed to policies and programs capable of increasing the resilience of vulnerable populations to climate change.

About the Livestock Vaccine Innovation Fund
The LVIF is a partnership between the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Global Affairs Canada (formerly Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada), and the International Development Research Centre. It represents a joint investment of CA$57 million over five years to support the development, production, and commercialization of innovative vaccines against priority livestock diseases in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia.

More specifically, the LVIF will support innovation and research to increase the efficacy, marketability, and use of existing vaccines, develop new vaccines against priority livestock diseases, and build effective research and public-private partnerships to accelerate the registration, commercialization, and use of vaccines. 

The research will also lead to a better understanding of disease dynamics and their impact, as well as the issues that constrain poor farmers from using vaccines. By bringing together all stakeholders - from farmers to researchers, pharmaceutical companies, and regulators - the LVIF will foster a vibrant and sustainable livestock sector in the target regions.

Separate Project Approval Documents will authorize individual research projects and activities related to research uptake and scale up, program synthesis, and communication.

Activities targeting rural and urban communities to alleviate hunger and reduce undernutrition as well as to enhance resilience were complemented by broader capacity development initiatives such as disaster risk reduction management and emergency simulation exercises.  

WFP's humanitarian assistance included the provision of food or cash-based transfers (CBT) to internally displaced persons (IDPs) and returnees affected by conflict, to people affected by economic stress or natural disasters, such as floods and landslides, as well as for the treatment of acutely malnourished children under five years of age and pregnant and lactating women (PLW). According to the Afghanistan National Nutrition Survey (NNS) 2013, 40.9 percent of children under five were chronically malnourished (stunted), 9.5 percent were acutely malnourished (wasted) and 24.6 percent underweight. 

The context of maternal and child nutrition status is characterised by a high prevalence of malnutrition, including micronutrient deficiencies, due to inadequate dietary intake, frequent infections and poor maternal outcomes. Maternal undernutrition is equally concerning with one-fifth of adolescent girls and women of reproductive age undernourished (low body mass index). Underweight women are more likely to give birth to low birthweight babies at higher risk of neonatal and infant death and stunted growth. The NNS 2013 showed that women and adolescent girls who had little or no formal education or came from impoverished households were more likely to be malnourished and deficient in essential micronutrients.

As part of its recovery strategy, WFP supported communities in their efforts to build productive assets that increase agricultural productivity and strengthen resilience to shocks. Additionally, WFP's recovery activities contributed to increased enrolment, attendance and learning capacity among primary and lower secondary school pupils through take-home rations, and among adults, particularly women, through vocational skills training activities.

Aligned with WFP Strategic Objectives 1, 2 and 4, the PRRO aimed to:

- respond to the food security and nutritional needs of IDPs and returnees affected by conflict, and people affected by natural disasters and economic stress (under Strategic Objective 1); 
- support the recovery of communities affected by shocks (under Strategic Objective 2); 
- treat moderately malnourished children under-5 and PLW (under Strategic Objective 4); 
- contribute to learning among primary and lower secondary school pupils and adults, particularly women (under Strategic Objective 4). 

Under capacity development, WFP's Purchase for Progress (P4P) initiative continued to procure locally produced high-energy biscuits (HEB) for emergency response, wheat grain from local small-holder farmer organizations and also to connect farmers with millers in order to create a sustainable institutional market for their surplus. This contributed to WFP's shift to more nutrition-sensitive entitlement baskets in mid-2015. WFP facilitated capacity development events for government staff, farmers and national counterparts. Training included major disaster response simulation exercises, with a focus on emergency preparedness and response capacity, food security analysis and disaster risk reduction (DRR).

The PRRO is aligned with the United Nations Development Assistance Framework (2014-2017) and the Government's National Priority Programmes under the Afghanistan National Development Strategy. In particular, the PRRO was linked to Cluster 5 (Agriculture and Rural Development) as well as Cluster 2 (Human Resource Development) of the National Priority Programmes.","False","False","Transaction",,"wfp","wfp"

The program aims to develop robust evidence to inform policies and practices capable of increasing the resilience of vulnerable populations. Its geographic focus consists of ""hot spots"" in Africa and Asia: semi-arid zones, mega-deltas and densely populated river basins (including glacier-fed systems). These hot spots combine two factors: significant impacts in the biophysical environment from climate change, and high risks to the livelihood of a large number of poor people with limited capacity to adapt.

Using different socio-economic scenarios and climate warming scenarios, researchers will develop a better understanding of the conditions that make poor people vulnerable to climate change. As well, researchers will identify sustainable adaptation measures that can be promoted within and across the hot spots. Research findings will provide decision-makers at the local, national and regional levels with robust scientific evidence needed to policies and programs capable of increasing the resilience of vulnerable populations to climate change.

Det föreslagna projektet bygger på två tidigare, 2005-2010 och 2011 -2014, multibilaterala projekt som Sida och Världsbanken finansierat där man gett stöd till att upprätta skogsbruksplaner i byarna och överföra nyttjanderätten från staten till kommuner och småbrukare. Sedan staten nationaliserade egendomar under kommunismen finns ingen privat ägande- eller nyttjanderätt av skogs- och betesmark. 
Den nytillträdda albanska regeringen vill låna 10 MUSD (IBRD) av Världsbanken för att investera i landsbygdsutveckling genom en bättre förvaltning av naturresurserna skog, biodiversitet, bete och därmed indirekt vatten. Miljöministeriet har med svenskt stöd utvecklat ett projekt benämnt Miljötjänster / Environmental Services Project och bett Sverige bidra med gåvomedel med samma belopp som lånet. Dessutom tillkommer 3 MUSD gåvomedel från Globala Miljöfonden (GEF) vilket förvaltas av Världsbanken i en fond (Trust Fund). 
Projektets övergripande målsättning är att stödja hållbar markförvaltning och öka samhällenas monetära och icke - monetära nytta, i riktade projektområden, framför allt i erosionsbenägna områden. Dessa mål ska nås genom stöd till alternativa försörjningsmöjligheter och tillhandahållande av miljötjänster och genom en finansiell, ekonomisk och institutionell hållbar användning av naturresursen. Ett mer affärsmässigt utvecklat jord- och skogbruk bedöms kunna öka de formella inkomsterna och samtidigt reducera erosionen och därmed sammanhängande översvämningar, liksom anpassning till ett förändrat klimatet. Projektet kommer att; 1) öka Albaniens institutionella kapacitet att hantera miljö och naturresurser genom integrerad landskapsförvaltning ; 2) planera och tillhandahålla bidrag med EU-liknande former 3) introducera marknadsmekanismer för miljötjänster; 4) stödja projektgenomförande genom (a) projektledning och (b) etablera och genomföra ett förvaltnings- och informationssystem.

This is done in areas such as climate change, biodiversity, land degradation, chemicals management, sustainable forestry and international waters. Under GEF5, the GEF and its partner agencies continue to provide financing for innovative technologies and policy development, and technical assistance and capacity development in developing countries. There are two priorities for GEF5: (1) to promote country ownership by better integrating GEF initiatives with national development planning processes, while increasing the participation of all stakeholders, including civil society; and (2) to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the GEF by focusing on operational reforms to ensure that the GEF can meet the environmental and developmental challenges of the future.   As a member of the 32-member GEF Council, Canada promotes programming and institutional reforms to: streamline the GEF project cycle; develop programmatic approaches; promote results-based management; and improve coordination between the GEF Secretariat and the ten institutions that implement GEF projects. During the Fifth Replenishment, Canada works toward strengthening the developmental impacts of GEF initiatives by further integrating gender and relevant social issues into all GEF activities.","False","False","Budget",1,"gac-amc","CA"

UNICEF works to improve the social and economic conditions of children by seeking to ensure that all the children in the world have access to health care, clean water, food and education, are protected from violence and abuse, and receive relief in disasters.   UNICEF works in over 155 countries and territories where it has acquired the respect and confidence of national authorities and partners. UNICEF's 2014-2017 Strategic Plan focuses on seven key priority areas: health; HIV/AIDS; water, sanitation and hygiene; nutrition; education; child protection; and, social inclusion. Cross-cutting themes include results-based management, gender equality, evaluation, human resources, humanitarian capacities and UN reform.   UNICEF is a long-standing and trusted partner of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada and is governed by an Executive Board of 36 member states, of which Canada is a rotational member. UNICEF's global presence and its capacity to provide leadership on child-related priorities, including during the sudden onset of emergencies, largely depends on a strong and reliable core income base.","False","False","Transaction",,"gac-amc","CA"

A second competitive call was launched in 2009, targeting seven countries in Latin America and five countries in South Asia (Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka). Of the 16 successful applicants from South Asia, nine are in India.

There are very few policy research organizations in South Asia outside India. Those that exist are fragile due to little demand for policy research, limited if no funding from local sources, and an often insecure political climate. This grant will strengthen the ability of the seven selected research institutions in Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka to provide, disseminate and communicate high-quality research. This will be achieved through measures aimed at enhancing the ability of staff to conduct sound research, improving organizational performance, and forging links with policymakers. Particular effort will be made to enable grantees to mobilize other sources of funding, so that none become dependent on the Think Tank Initiative over the long term. The project will also support a platform for grantee networking both within the Initiative and with a wider network of institutions engaged in policy-related research.

In 2005 and 2010, these two factors led to food scarcity in Niger. However, innovative technologies such as microdose fertilization combined with rainwater catchment could improve soil fertility and moisture, thereby increasing crop yields.

Microdosage is the addition of small amounts of fertilizer to plants at the time of seeding or after germination. Even though this technology can increase yields by up to 120%, only 5% of producers in the Sahel use it. This low rate of adoption is due to inability to buy inputs, weak policy support and insufficient investment in agricultural services, including extension.

This project - supported by the Canadian International Food Security Research Fund (CIFSRF), a joint program of IDRC and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) - will identify the appropriate means of microcredit for promoting microdosage, examine the social and political factors that influence food security, and evaluate the long-term effects of microdosage and rainwater collection on the dynamics of nutrient cycling and groundwater in monoculture and intercropped systems in the Sahel.

Forests developed in this landscape would contribute to a stable forest ecosystem that can be tolerant of future disturbances and change, including those caused by climate change. The long-term management of these forest stands will also promote their sustainability. Finally, the second component is the two-institutional support and technology enhancement. This component includes: nursery upgrading and planting material development, forest cooperatives, research, technical service and extension, project Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E), and project management and institutional development.","False","False","Budget",1,"worldbank","ida"

Plan Sverige har inkommit med en ansökan om rambidrag på sammanlagt 452 000 000 kr för en 3,5-årsperiod som börjar i januari 2015 och fortsätter till 30 juni 2018. Anledningen till att avtalsperioden föreslås vara 3,5 år är att Sida har ställt sig positivt till att anpassa avtalsperioden och rapporteringsschemat till Plan Sveriges brutna räkenskapsår. Budgeten för verksamheten ligger på en högre nivå än tidigare år, och ett godkännande av den föreslagna budgetnivån skulle innebära en höjning av rambidraget med drygt 28 procent (från drygt 101 MSEK per år till 130 MSEK per år). Sida bedömer att ökningen är välplanerad och bygger på styrkorna i tidigare program. Ansökan är skriven i enlighet med instruktionen för stöd under Strategin för stöd genom det svenska civilsamhället. Sida bedömer att ansökan är komplett och att verksamheten är relevant i förhållande till strategin.

Ansökande organisation:
Plan Sverige är en del av den internationella barnrättsfederationen Plan International som har verksamhet och landkontor i över 50 länder i Afrika, Asien och Latinamerika. Plan Sverige grundades 1997 och är en av 21 nationella organisationer i Plan-federationen. Plan Sverige är en stiftelse (inte en medlemsorganisation). Däremot har organisationen ett starkt nätverk av faddrar som varje år bidrar med mer än 60 procent av organisationens budget. Medlen från fadderverksamheten ger Plan (både internationellt och i Sverige) en stabilitet som ger möjligheter att fastanställa personal oberoende av eventuell kortsiktighet hos givare, samt betala för budgetposter som tidvis är svåra att samla in medel till. Plan Sverige har varit ramorganisation sedan 2006 (förnyad ramstatus 2014) och Sidas samlade erfarenhet av ramsamarbetet är god. På senare år har organisationen även fått status som strategisk partner för Sidas humanitära enhet och ECHO-status för samarbete med EU i humanitära frågor. 

Plan Sverige har under de senaste åren stärkt sin personalstyrka, och närmare 20 personer är på olika sätt delaktiga i att hantera ramanslaget. Av dessa är sju regionsamordnare, fem tematiska rådgivare, en programekonom, en verksamhetscontroller på heltid (ny tjänst), chefer, samordnare av institutionella givare och administrativ personal.

Plan Sverige samarbetar med Plan Internationals landkontor för insatsen, och landkontoren fungerar både som vidareförmedlare till civilsamhällesorganisationer och som genomförare av delar av programmet. Beredningen av insatsen har i största möjliga mån försökt bedöma landkontorens kapacitet i båda dessa roller. 

Sida bedömer att Plan Sverige fortsatt är en relevant partner i ramsamabetet med kapacitet att hantera ramanslag från Sida.

Ansökan:
Ansökan för perioden 2015-2018 har till syfte att ""barn och ungdomar, tillsammans med civilsamhället, kräver sina rättigheter från ansvarstagare som aktivt engagerar sig för att respektera, skydda och uppfylla dessa rättigheter"" (fritt översatt). Verksamheten ska ske i 19 länder, fyra regionala initiativ samt ett globalt program för påverkansarbete och innovation. Plan Sveriges ansökan är i stort en fortsättning på den verksamhet som organisationen haft under de senaste fyra åren under två avtal: Ramavtalet och avtalet gällande regeringens satsning på barns och ungdomars rätt till hälsa och utbildning. Nuvarande ansökan har för första gången helt integrerat de två ansatserna, och har resulterat i fem tematiska resultatområden/program:

1. Barns och ungdomars rätt till skydd från våld
2. Barns och ungdomars rätt till sexuell och reproduktiv hälsa
3. Barns och ungdomars medborgarskap och samhällsstyrning
4. Barnrättsstyrning
5. Barns rättigheter i katastrofsituationer (riskförebyggande och motståndskraft)

Sida bedömer att programmet är väl sammansatt, bygger på Plan Sveriges och Plan Internationals styrkor och på väl beprövande metoder - tillsammans med en vilja att hitta innovativa sätt att nå ännu bättre resultat.

Open data drives change
In Brazil, Nepal, and Nigeria, people are using publicly available government budget data to track and fight corruption. Data analysts and IT developers in other developing countries are helping to improve public service delivery by transforming newly available government data on education, health, and crime into Web or mobile applications that allow people to use the information to improve their everyday lives. 

Open data, including its many platforms and apps, is fuelling social change, innovation, and development.

Why the Himalayan region is important
The region, stretching from central Afghanistan to northern Pakistan, is one of the world's most dynamic, diverse, and complex mountain and floodplain systems. It provides water resources and other ecosystem services to more than 210 million people in the mountains and 1.3 billion people living downstream. 

How this research will support adaptation
Socio-economic changes, combined with climate change impacts, may significantly affect the livelihoods of everyone in the region. To help the people of Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, and Nepal adapt, this project will develop robust evidence to inform climate change adaptation policies and practices. 

Researchers will focus on the Indus, Ganges, and Brahmaputra river basins. They will compare research and pilot results analyzing adaptation interventions at a variety of sites. The research sites will represent a range of climatic and hydrological conditions and socio-economic contexts. Stakeholders will be actively involved in the process.

Expected research results
A research consortium with a reputation for excellence will lead the project, which is expected to:
-generate scientific knowledge on climate change impacts, vulnerability drivers, and adaptation policies and practices; 
-promote decision-makers' use of knowledge and adaptation practices at various scales to reduce vulnerabilities and build livelihood resilience; and 
-strengthen interdisciplinary expertise in climate change adaptation and resilience research. 

These outcomes will allow governments to improve their adaptation policies and practices. They will also help ensure that funds can be mobilized for sustainable adaptation strategies.","False","False","Transaction",,"idrccrdi","CA"

Citizens in these countries want security and representation. Equally important challenges exist in strong and democratic states when extending their authority into geographically isolated areas or inner city slums. These communities, or enclaves, can create structures of violence which are difficult to overcome.

This project will fund dialogues to improve urban and citizen security to address these challenges. The work will be conducted in Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, and South Africa, which are on the frontlines of violence in non-conflict settings. 

The project will enhance the evidence base on this topic and examine the strategies being used. With the Geneva Declaration Secretariat estimating annual global costs at between US$95 to $163 billion, the knowledge generated by the project will help policymakers and governments address the high cost of armed violence in non-conflict settings. High crime rates also divert state resources to law enforcement, even though they are often ineffective at keeping citizens safe. The numbers of indirect deaths from conflicts and deaths from non-conflict violence are increasing, even as the numbers of direct deaths from conflicts are decreasing.

The project will bring policymakers, academics, and practitioners from these countries together to develop an international knowledge network committed to finding strategies to deal with armed violence in non-conflict settings. Members of the network will share and transfer evidence-based approaches to promoting social stability and safety in cities with chronic violence. The exchanges will take place between frontline developing countries, given that they are best placed to develop effective and innovative home-grown solutions.","False","False","Transaction",,"idrccrdi","CA"

It builds on an earlier Canadian International Food Security Research Fund project, which demonstrated that hexanal (a widely used biochemical compound) can be a successful tool for addressing the problem. 

Advancing science, enhancing fruit life
The project uses cutting-edge science to extend and optimize the use of hexanal for pre- and post-harvest applications to other commercial fruits, such as bananas, papaya, and citrus. Researchers will improve packaging systems for transporting fruit using hexanal impregnated bionanoparticles and biowax dip treatments. 

The Tamil Nadu Agricultural University in India, the Industrial Technology Institute in Sri Lanka, and the University of Guelph in Canada will work with research institutions in the West Indies, Kenya, and Tanzania to generate new knowledge on innovations with hexanal sprays, biowax, and nanopackaging materials. They will also look at opportunities for commercializing the technologies at scale.

Taking new technologies to market
Research on scaling up will identify suitable, practical methods for wide-scale adoption and market entry. Options include:
-producing nanofibre matrices for commercial use
-applying the technologies to larger volumes of fruits
-packaging for different market requirements
-extending the lessons from mangoes to other tropical fruits

The use of green nanotechnologies from biowastes, instead of metal- or carbon-based nanoparticles, is environmentally sustainable and lowers production costs. 

Improving lives and livelihoods
The project is expected to significantly reduce post-harvest losses, improving incomes and livelihoods for smallholder fruit farmers living in the five target countries. It is also expected to lead to new economic opportunities for women farmers engaged in post-harvest operations.

As confirmed with LCSDE, since the extension is below twenty four months from the current project closing date, as approved by the Board at the time of the approval of the additional financing. The project is in the final stages of implementation and has been making satisfactory progress towards the achievement of its development objectives. The project implementation is also rated satisfactory.

De interventies in de landbouw zullen te samen met de rehabilitatie van de landbouwwegen worden gerealiseerd in dezelfde 4 concentratiegebieden, namelijk de districten Kwilu en Kwango (province Bandundu), de districten Tshilenge, Kabinda en Sankuru (province Kasaï Oriental), het district Tshopo (province Orientale), en het zuiden van de provincie Maniema. Hiervoor worden omstandige budgetten voorzien: 63,5 miljoen EUR voor landbouw en 89 miljoen EUR voor rurale ontsluiting, samen goed voor 152,5 miljoen EUR of 50% van het totale budget van het ISP 2010-13 (300 miljoen).
Eind mei 2012 heeft het bureau ontwikkelingssamenwerking van Ambabel Kinshasa met de Congolese overheid een identificatie atelier georganiseerd in Kisangani. Dit atelier leverde de basiselementen aan voor de opmaak van twee identificatiefiches, één voor de sector landbouw (Programme de Développement Agricole dans de district de la Tshopo - PRODAT) en de andere voor de sector Pistes et bacs (Programme de Désenclavement dans le District de la Tshopo - PRODET). De beide identificatiefiches namen de te verwachten resultaten van het ISP 2010-2013 voor de sectoren landbouw en Pistes et bacs min of meer over. Het partnercomité (Comité des Partenaires - COMPAR) heeft op 27 september 2012 de beide identificatiefiches goedgekeurd (zie identificatiefiche PRODET in bijlage 2) en er kon bijgevolg worden overgegaan tot de formulering van die twee interventies. Evenwel, gezien hun nauwe verbondenheid  (het is het landbouwprogramma dat de te ontsluiten plattelandswegen bepaald), besloot het speciale partnercomité van 15 januari 2013 ( zie PV COMPAR in annex 9.2 van formuleringsrapport in bijlage 3) beide interventies samen te smelten tot één programma (PRODADET) bestaande uit twee luiken en waarvoor dus nog maar één formulering nodig was. 

De formulering van het project heeft acht maanden in beslag genomen (van april tot december 2013). De twee identificatiefiches werden trouw gevolgd, maar naar het einde van de formulering toe werden de twee oorspronkelijke projectfiches toch samengesmolten tot één nieuwe projectfiche met nog één specifieke doelstelling maar met een luik landbouw en een luik ontsluiting (zie p. 14 van formuleringrapport in bijlage 3). 

Na de formulering van PRODADET werd door de budgettaire toezichthoudende instanties geoordeeld dat de 2 initiële projecten niet konden worden samen gesmolten tot één dossier.  Het formuleringsteam van BTC heeft het dossier PRODADET terug opgesplitst in de oorspronkelijk twee voorziene dossiers PRODAT en PRODET. Voor PRODET werd in mei 2014 een extra missie naar Tshopo georganiseerd om een inventaris te maken van de te rehabiliteren plattelandswegen en een zo realistisch mogelijke schatting van de kosten voor de rehabilitatie van deze wegen (zie punt 7.5 van DTF in bijlage ) evenals voor de kosten van onderhoud (zie punt 7.6 van DTF in bijlage 4 ).

This research will test whether their development assistance approaches are more effective at addressing the political and social realities of fragile states than those used by traditional donors. 

Recent evidence points to greater numbers of emerging powers engaging in fragile states. Their motives vary by country and over time. 

Emerging economies argue that their approach to development and security is different because they have experienced similar challenges in their recent past. Their national experiences provide them with more relevant insights into the obstacles affecting other developing countries, especially in institution building. They argue that their approach to local ownership, which is sensitive to sovereignty and partnership, is distinct from conventional donor-recipient relationships.

Response to these emerging actors has been mixed. Governments look to these donors for development grants that, they argue, are not accompanied by restrictive conditions. On the other hand, citizens of these countries have misgivings about the effects of emerging powers on their day-to-day livelihoods. The presence of China in Africa, for example, has led to demonstrations in some African countries such as Zambia, Sierra Leone, and Kenya.

Three prepositions will guide this project:
-There may be unavoidable tensions between confidence building, legitimacy, and institution building in fragile states, especially in the early stabilization and post-conflict period.
-Tensions can be managed by international efforts that understand the reality of trade-offs and that use a political settlement approach to build or reform institutions.
-Emerging powers' experiences can be a source of valuable knowledge about analyzing political settlements and designing interventions to build security and justice institutions.

The project team will examine South Africa's involvement in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Turkey's role in Somalia, particularly in the areas of security and justice. Researchers will study how development actors working in fragile situations can help enhance legitimacy, support stable and effective political settlements, and build confidence across parties in states. They will also examine local perceptions about the new approaches and how their impact on daily life. 

The study will select a sample of traditional donors that are heavily engaged in these countries to compare with the engagement of emerging powers. 

The project will provide a better understanding of effective approaches. It will also generate new knowledge on whether assumptions made about the effectiveness of these approaches are valid. 

Findings will be shared with traditional and emerging donors to help them develop more effective and context-specific donor programs, and with national and regional policymakers, and civil society organizations.","False","False","Transaction",,"idrccrdi","CA"

- meet the food security and nutrition needs of women, men, girls, and boys affected by conflict and natural disasters in Mindanao; 
- enhance government and community disaster preparedness, and response systems at the national and some sub-national levels to ensure timely responses to natural disasters; 
- advise government departments on the development of gender-responsive food security and nutrition policies; and
- provide life-saving food assistance in response to disasters.

Using different socio-economic scenarios and climate warming scenarios, researchers will develop a better understanding of the conditions that make poor people vulnerable to climate change. As well, researchers will identify sustainable adaptation measures that can be promoted within and across the hot spots. Research findings will provide decision-makers at the local, national and regional levels with robust scientific evidence needed to policies and programs capable of increasing the resilience of vulnerable populations to climate change.

SSEESS är ett program inom KVA som syftar till att bygga nya allianser och tvärvetenskapliga initiativ för att bemöta de utmaningar som tornar upp sig på miljö, resurs och klimatförändringar. Detta skall ske i form av samarbete med svenska forskare och med International Council for Science (ICSU), dess Regional Office for Africa (ICSU ROA) och med andra internationella organisationer.

Programmet skall underlätta för svenska forskares deltagande i internationella forskningsprogram inom området globala miljöförändringar och hållbar utveckling, samt att vara en pålitlig källa till information om dessa frågor för svenska beslutsfattare.

Sidas stöd till programmet i form av en sekundering baseras på regeringens strategi för Sidas stöd till forskningssamarbete 2010 med syfte att stärka kunskaps- och forskningskapaciteten i utvecklingsländer. SSEESS ska i samarbete med Sida främja deltagande av forskare från utvecklingsländer i globala forskningsprogram och globala avtal i samband med miljö och klimatförändring, och att öka möjligheten för svenska 'global environmental change' (GEC) forskare att interagera med forskarsamhället inom hållbar utveckling och bistånd på global, regional och lokal nivå.","True","True","Budget",,"sida","SE"

The project is now at a phase when different activities under the three components start fitting together, allowing the Project to achieve its overall objective. Given the extension, end of project target dates for achieving final results will be adjusted accordingly. The extension is necessary to complete ongoing management information system (MIS) related activities, which are a key to attaining the project development objective (PDO). The key milestones established as conditions for considering project extension have been met, particularly in terms of completion of civil works and development of the MIS. The project's implementation schedule has been revised to allow completing it by the proposed closing date. This revised schedule puts project activities into a tight timeframe and leaves no room for delays. Recent payment delays by the national treasury affected income tax (IT) contracts execution. Therefore, the team agreed to reduce the minimum application size for payments directly from the loan account from USD1.8 million to USD200,000 for a six month period and already communicated this decision to the Borrower.

The Policy Community Survey is a key element of the strategy. It aims to reveal national policy stakeholders' perceptions of their needs for, and use of, information in policymaking. It also highlights their perceptions of the quality, value, and availability of research findings produced by think tanks. It seeks to understand their thoughts around the capacity of think tanks to undertake high quality policy-relevant research and to influence policymaking processes. 

This project aims to shed light on the nature of the demand side of the wider policy community in which think tanks operate in a specific country. It will examine perceptions around the role of think tanks as national policy contributors. It will offer knowledge to allow think tanks to assess their own performance. This will help them identify critical organizational capacity needs that should be met. Finally, the project aims to identify broad policy community changes in a particular country over time, along with the extent to which each think tank is perceived to have adapted to those changes.

Specifically, it will seek to:
-develop an understanding of the policy community in specific countries;
-understand the strengths and weaknesses of particular think tanks;
-understand what activities are associated with the success of think tanks;
-help prioritize support strategies, such as funding, training, and technical assistance; and,
-track changes over time by comparing the results with those from the first round of the survey.   

The first round of the Policy Community Survey was undertaken in the 23 countries where TTI operates, beginning in Africa (11 countries), then Latin America (seven countries), and South Asia (five countries). A total of 985 high-level respondents were interviewed between 2009 and 2011. These include groups of policy actors such as government, non-governmental organizations, media, multilateral/bilateral organizations, the private sector, research/academia, and trade unions. 

The second round of the Policy Community Survey is based on the methodology and findings from the first round. The survey will be conducted in 10 African countries, seven Latin American countries, and five South Asian countries.  
The findings will provide a new data set that supplements the initial baseline. This will help to compare shifts in perceptions among policy stakeholders of their information needs for policymaking and of the performance of think tanks, including individual TTI grantees. The survey will also create a deeper understanding of the national policy environment in which think tanks operate, and the extent to which their research outputs are used and perceived as valuable. This information will be provided to grantees as a valuable source of reflection on their own national policy engagement and outreach strategies, to TTI to inform its support to organizational development, and beyond.","False","False","Transaction",,"idrccrdi","CA"

-	Människors rätt till sexuell och reproduktiv hälsa och rättigheter har stärkts.
-	Människor som lever i utsatthet har rätt till grundläggande trygghet och har stärkt social och ekonomisk egenmakt.
-	Människor har fått ökad trygghet, möjlighet och egenmakt att hantera konflikter och delta i freds- och försoningsprocesser.
-	Kvinnor och män har förbättrade förutsättningar och möjligheter till jämställt deltagande, röst och ledarskap i kyrka och samhälle.
-	Människors rätt till kroppslig och sexuell integritet i kyrka och samhälle har stärkts. 

Svenska kyrkan har föreslagit en förlängning av insatsen, på basis av dess existerande resultatramverk, med en budget på 119 419 916 SEK för år 2017 vilket motsvarar en ökning om 23% jämfört med föregående år. Utifrån en samlad bedömning och med hänsyn till tillgängliga anslagsmedel föreslås i Sidas beredning att ansökan för 2017 finansieras med 105 000 000 SEK. Ny total budget för insatsen 2014-2017 blir därmed 396 000 000 SEK.

För år 2017 har Svenska kyrkan budgeterat för utbetalningar till lokala samarbetsparter till en summa på 108 523 921 SEK, varav 94 904 250 SEK ingår i ansökan för 2017 och resterande del är utbetalningar av Sida-medel som redan är avtalade inom Svenska kyrkans EU-projekt. Denna totala andel som vidareförmedlas uppgår till 70% av totala budgeten för ram-insatsen och den redan avtalade EU-insatsen, beräknat på andelen utbetalningar som går direkt till lokala parter som Svenska kyrkan har avtal med. Att Svenska kyrkan räknar in Sida-stödet till egeninsatsen till sitt EU-projekt i andelen som vidareförmedlas påverkar inte bedömningen av ansökan för 2017. För tydlighetens skull kommer dock Sida be Svenska kyrkan att redovisa Sida-stödet till EU-insatsen separat i nästa ansökan. Av de medel som vidareförmedlas 2017 kommer 46 MSEK fördelas till parter i Afrika (Etiopien, Liberia, Sydafrika, Sydsudan, Uganda och Zimbabwe), 11,5 MSEK till Asien (Indien och Burma/Myanmar), 23 MSEK till Latinamerika (Colombia, Guatemala, Honduras och Haiti), och 14,4 MSEK till Mellanöstern (Egypten och Israel/Palestina). Inga utbetalningar kommer att ske till internationella avtalsparter eller svenska CSO. 

De lokala samarbetsparterna uppgår till omkring 110 CSO och/eller CSO-nätverk. Storleken på bidragen varierar mellan 80 000 SEK till omkring 5 MSEK. Svenska kyrkan räknar Lutherska världsförbundets (LVF) lokala/nationellt registrerade landkontor bland sina lokala CSO-partners. Svenska kyrkans samarbete med de lokala LVF-programmen utgör en stor andel av det totala stöd som förmedlas  närmare 22 %. I förlängningsansökan 2017 motsvarar det totalt 24,5 MSEK. Av dessa går 282 000 SEK till ett globalt program som administreras av kontoret i Genève  alla övriga medel går direkt till LVF:s landprogram och det arbete dessa kontor bedriver självständigt i samverkan med lokala CSO. Med egna medel stödjer Svenska kyrkan utöver detta den koordinerande funktionen i Geneve med 4,9 MSEK 2017, vilket kommer det lokala arbetet till godo bland annat gällande kvalitetssäkring och utvärdering. Medan den koordinerande funktionen via LVF i Genève bidrar med kvalitetssäkring av LVF-projekten, genomför Svenska kyrkans personal kvalitetssäkringen av övriga projekt inom programmet.

Initially, the operation aimed to support around 300,000 internally displaced Malians and around 255,000 refugees crossing borders into neighbouring Burkina Faso, Mauritania and Niger. Four budget revisions led to an adjustment of refugee numbers and the transition of internally displaced Malians to the Mali single country EMOP. Only refugees assisted in the three neighbouring countries stayed under the regional emergency operation, assisting 145,000 refugees overall. Burkina Faso considerably reduced its refugee numbers by shifting their focus to assisting refugees settled in official camps and not unofficial sites, and by using biometric registration provided by UNHCR to verify refugee lists. In Mauritania and Niger, refugee numbers remained stable, but towards the end of 2014, Niger stopped providing assistance to Nigerien returnees as they were meant to return to their places of origin, and only refugees received continuous assistance.

Security in northern Mali deteriorated further during 2014. Inter-Malian peace talks in Algiers convened intermittently from August to November 2014. Attacks targeting the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) and aid workers increased. Since September 2013, 31 peacekeepers have been killed and 90 wounded. In 2015 attacks continued increasing as armed groups aimed to strengthen claims for territorial autonomy by consolidating control over strategic areas ahead of and during negotiations. Reprisals against returning refugees prohibited largescale returns.

The main objectives of the EMOP are to:
(i) Support the food security of Malian refugees in Burkina Faso, Mauritania and Niger through general food distributions (GFD) using food, cash and/or voucher modalities.
(ii) Prevent and treat moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) among children aged 6-59 months and pregnant and lactating women (PLW) through blanket supplementary feeding (BSF) and targeted supplementary feeding (TSF).
(iii) Support emergency school feeding activities for refugees.

The regional EMOP's nutrition activities were aligned with and complemented WFP's Regional Response Framework for the Sahel drought. The emergency operation was aligned to WFP Strategic Objective 1 ""Save lives and protect livelihoods in emergencies"" and contributed toward Millennium Development Goals 1 ""Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger"", 4 ""Reduce child mortality"" and 5 ""Improve maternal health.""

The EMOP was modified twice in 2015: in January, to extend its duration for twelve months, from 1 January to 31 December 2015, to accommodate continuing needs of Malian refugees (budget revision 7); and in October 2015, to include additional needs that resulted from the delays in the deactivation process (budget revision 8).

It consists of following two sub-components: (i) first phase of ONEE's solar PV program (the Noor-Tafilalt Project) in the project area, and (ii) enabling environment for private participation in distributed PV generation. The second component is planning and dispatching of renewable energies. The scattered location of renewable energy installations throughout a country, even connected to medium voltage grids, has also favored the global trend of creating centralized control centers to coordinate different power supply units and to avoid local problems such as grid congestions.

This can influence the health of both adults and children. Since both adults and children spend about 90% of their life indoors, indoor pollution is also important. It has been estimated that globally, indoor air pollution is responsible for nearly 2 million excess deaths per year in developing countries, and for about 4% of the global burden of disease. Both indoor and outdoor air pollution has the strongest impact on the poorer part of the population, because higher exposure levels, and higher susceptibility due to higher exposure levels and poorer nutritional status. In China, the building stock is rapidly increasing, and new building material, building techniques are introduced and there is an increase of energy use in buildings. This may have consequences for the indoor environment. Dietary pattern is changing, and there is evidence that the levels and chemical contamination of food products is significant and higher than in Europe. One important type of food contamination is by phthalates, bis-phenol A and other hormone disrupting chemicals. We have had co-operation with China (Shanxi University and Fudan University and others) since 1998 and we have published about 20 scientific articles together. The co-operation will give education within environmental medicine, environmental science and dietary aspects, with a focus on health studies in school and pre-school children. We will establish new large cohorts of school children and perform repeat studies in China to study trends in asthma, allergy and respiratory disease, and perform new studies in pre-school children and study the indoor environment in schools and day care centres. We will evaluate the biological properties (oxidative capacity) of airborne outdoor and indoor particles from different parts of China. Moreover we will study effects of dietary pattern on asthma, allergy and respiratory disease in Chinese children, and study food allergy food intolerance, and study associations between phthalates and other hormone disrupting environmental contaminants in food, and asthma allergy and respiratory disease, by analysing urine levels of chemical contaminants. Our co-operation will contribute to the increase of knowledge and skill in environmental epidemiology in China, especially with respect to the environment in schools and day care centres but also the home environment, This will increase the possibility to work with primary prevention in this field. Moreover we will add new and important knowledge on important risk factors for asthma, allergy, food allergy and intolerance, and respiratory disease in Chinese children. Thus our project has important relevance both from a scientific and epidemiological point of view and as a contribution to the primary prevention work in China.","True","False","Transaction",,"sida","SE"

Intercommunity conflict, civilian kidnappings and criminal activities persisted in many regions, and insecurity along roads and distribution sites continued to impede humanitarian access to certain areas. The unrest in Bangui in late September 2015 caused over 48,000 people to flee their homes at a time when thousands of displaced people were in the process of returning. According to UNHCR, as of November 2015, 447,000 people were internally displaced in C.A.R., 40 percent of them located in IDP sites. 
Outside C.A.R, as of November 2014, more than 420,000 refugees, returnees, and third country nationals have taken refuge in neighboring Cameroon, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and Republic of Congo (RoC). Populations arriving in Cameroon came with no belongings; adults and children arrived with illnesses and injuries, and many suffering malnutrition after a long journey without food, water, or shelter. In Chad, the population profile was mixed, including both refugees and a large proportion of persons considered by the Chadian government to be returnees. In DRC, refugees settled in remote territories, where they lacked reliable livelihoods or coping mechanisms to meet basic food needs and, in host areas with an already precarious food security situation. Similarly, refugees arriving in RoC, who showed signs of moderate and acute malnutrition, were settled in two sites. 

Regional Emergency Operation 200799 (EMOP) responds to the life-saving needs of populations affected by the ongoing crisis in C.A.R. and its regional impact in Cameroon, Chad, DRC and RoC. The regional operation focused on ensuring life-saving needs of vulnerable populations in conflict-affected communities, the displaced and refugee/returnee sites. The operation is in line with Strategic Objective 1, ""Save lives and protect livelihoods in emergencies"" and aimed to: (i) improve food consumption and access to markets; (ii) stabilize undernutrition; and (iii) restore access to basic services. Elements fostering social cohesion, investment in human capital, and support for agricultural production alongside partners are integrated into the life-saving response.

In 2015 the social-political environment in C.A.R. remained extremely complex, and was characterized by continued sporadic surges of extreme violence against a backdrop of a survival economy and fragmented armed groups. The crisis led to large population displacements and severe humanitarian and economic implications as livelihoods and trade were disrupted or destroyed. Household assets and reserves were being depleted and the scale and severity of food insecurity levels among the population became unprecedented. Volatile security, inaccessibility, restrictions on movement and reduced presence of staff and partners in field locations remained important obstacles to meeting targets. Against this backdrop, the EMOP aimed to: (i) refine and re-focus targeting based on latest assessments - with a focus on rural areas; (ii) diversify activities and modalities to provide flexible seasonal support to moderately food-insecure households; (iii) support restoration of access to basic services and human capital protection; (iv) strengthen and stabilize the WFP country and sub-office staffing structure; and (v) reinforce supply chain management and alternative corridors to meet high monthly tonnage requirements.
The regional focus allowed to reaffirm visibility and a common advocacy around the crisis and its regional implications, while supporting a more equitable distribution of resources across the five countries. Beyond the programmatic response, the regional lens also reinforced a broader view of supply chain management of the operation, recognizing shared challenges and opportunities.","False","False","Transaction",,"wfp","wfp"

The operation contributed to the advancement of a regional approach to food insecurity and disaster management in Central America, as WFP's emergency responses were aligned with the governments-endorsed Regional Disaster Reduction Plan (2006-2015). Food security and nutrition activities were also compatible with the Second Regional Programme for Food and Nutrition Security in Central America. This operation was aligned to Strategic Objectives 1, 2 and 3.

Coffee production and processing provides a livelihood source for more than two million people in the CA4. The resurgence of the coffee rust plague in the region affected over 50 percent of the coffee-growing areas during the 2012/13 harvest cycle, negatively impacting rural jobs (International Coffee Organization. 2013. ""Report on the Outbreak of Coffee Leaf Rust in Central America and Action Plan to Combat the Pest"").

In 2013, the PRRO responded to the effects of floods, earthquake, the prolonged impact of the 2012 drought, and the coffee rust infestation in the CA4. PRRO activities aligned with national priorities and supported the capacity development of government counterparts. CA4 activities focused on immediate relief through general food distributions (GFD) and also supplementary feeding in Guatemala to populations affected by shocks, in line with WFP Strategic Objective 1. In addition, early recovery activities in the form of food assistance for assets (FFA) and food assistance for training (FFT) interventions were implemented, in line with WFP Strategic Objective 3.

Through budget revision 2, processed in 2012, the project was extended for the four countries to December 2013 and assistance was scaled up in Guatemala and El Salvador in view of the deteriorating food security and livelihoods situation for communities severely affected by successive shocks (drought in 2012 and tropical depression (TD-12E) in 2011). Honduras and Nicaragua also maintained needs. In 2013, budget revision 3 increased response further in Guatemala to support the government in mitigating the effects of the coffee rust.

Beneficiaries targeted in 2013 included vulnerable families affected by earthquake (Guatemala), drought (Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador), floods (Guatemala, Nicaragua) and the coffee rust infestation in all four countries. Emergency Food Security Assessments (EFSAs) or government assessment tools were used to target beneficiaries and participatory community-based planning was utilized to identify and implement appropriate activities.","False","False","Transaction",,"wfp","wfp"

It can be caused by development projects, conflict, or natural disasters. It is a traumatic process because it can involve loss of housing, income, livelihoods, assets, and access to natural resources. This research project will examine the interplay between involuntary displacement, violence, inequality, and poverty on re-settled populations living in urban communities.

The project will seek to identify and, where possible, quantify the links between the violence of forced displacement and the level of poverty and inequality. Researchers will investigate these linkages in two cities in Sri Lanka (Colombo and Jaffna) and one city in India (Cochin) where urban displacement and resettlement are significant issues.

There is limited information on how displaced people cope with the risks associated with accommodation, eviction, nutrition, the basic needs of women and children, legal status, and protection at urban locations. The lack of context-based household survey data has hindered the process of:
- counting the numbers of those affected;
- planning strategies to help them; and, 
- creating evidence-based interventions. 

South Asia has little in the way of studies on the violence, urbanization, and inequality experienced by displaced people in urban contexts. The state, private sector, and international aid agencies have been unable to cope with the massive influx of displaced people into cities. It is therefore essential to develop evidence-based strategies to help those trying to rebuild their lives.

This study will target returned, resettled, and relocated people following development-induced or conflict-induced displacement. It will look at their urban host communities which have been mostly spared from displacement. Researchers will conduct an extensive literature review. They will also conduct a quantitative and qualitative survey to document the impact of violence on settlers in the fragile post-war reality of Sri Lanka and the relatively stable reality of Cochin, India.

This project is part of the Safe and Inclusive Cities (SAIC) research initiative designed to build an evidence base on the connections between urban violence, poverty, and inequalities. Jointly funded by IDRC and the United Kingdom's Department for International Development, the SAIC program also seeks to identify the most effective strategies for addressing these challenges in Latin America and the Caribbean, South Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa.

This open government data movement can foster greater civic participation and promote new business opportunities.

Worldwide, governments have posted an estimated one-million datasets on the Internet. A small fraction of these datasets comes from developing countries, but this is changing rapidly. Citizens in Brazil, Nepal, and Nigeria can now use publicly available government budget data to track and fight corruption. Developers and entrepreneurs across Latin America, Africa, and Asia can create Web and mobile applications using government data on education, health, and crime to promote smarter and more efficient local public services.

In the developed world, open government data has delivered economic benefits. The re-use of public sector data in the Eurozone generated EUR32 billion in 2010. A UK study valued the economic impact of open government data at GBP6 billion per year. Qualitative evidence shows that open data can stem corruption and increase accountability. Much less is known about its impact in the developing world.

Open government data offers the potential for greater government accountability, efficiency, and transparency in the developing world. It can also create new economic opportunities for all segments of society. However, rigorous evidence on the use, outcomes, and impact of these objectives remains scarce. Those responsible for funding and implementing these programs must understand emerging best practices. They must also have insight into the varying impacts of open data in strikingly different social, economic, and cultural contexts. 

This project will help create a research network to explore the implications of releasing government data. More specifically, it will aim to:

-generate research on the emerging impacts of open data interventions
-deliver policy and practice findings that can inform local and global debates
-build research capacity worldwide to explore the emerging impacts of open data.

The World Wide Web Foundation will administer the proposed research network. The organization promotes and supports an Internet that is open, usable, and valuable for everyone, particularly developing countries. It will include 18 partners in Latin America, Africa, and Asia who will undertake case studies to assess existing initiatives, challenges, emerging outcomes, and impacts. 

The research will address key issues and gaps in knowledge. For example, well-intentioned open data initiatives may cause adverse effects by exacerbating social or economic inequalities. They can favour well-resourced groups that are more capable of extracting value from the data for their own economic and political gain. Commercial elites in Bangalore, for example, have used the digitization of land records to find gaps in title and errors in documentation to gain ownership of land occupied by poor communities.

The project will also develop data collection instruments to help explain if and how open data is bringing change to developing countries. It will engage policymakers at global and local levels to foster robust evidence-based practice in this emerging policy area.","False","False","Transaction",,"idrccrdi","CA"

This grant will provide support to the 2014 Africa Science Journalists Conference. The conference will provide a platform where journalists, policymakers, and scientists can come together to explore ways to bridge the gap between science and policy-making.
 
Connecting scientists and journalists
In August 2012, Media for Environment, Science, Health and Agriculture (MESHA) hosted the first Africa-wide conference of science journalists. The event brought together journalists, communication practitioners, and policymakers. During the conference, it became apparent that a gap exists between how scientists communicate on science, how journalists report on science, and on how policymakers rely on scientific evidence when developing policies, if at all. 

While the last decade saw increased interaction between scientists and journalists, there remains a large communication gap between scientists and policymakers. While policymakers formulate the decisions that govern science, they often do not have the information they need to consider the public's needs and responses to certain policy decisions. This is where the role of the journalist is important. Scientists, on the other hand, often lack the outlets and skills to present their work in language or formats that are targeted to policymakers.

Improving science reporting
MESHA will address these challenges by convening journalists, scientists, and policymakers at the 2014 conference. Participants will discuss how science reporting can be improved to effectively portray science issues. The goal is to influence policy and bring health, agriculture, and environment issues to a wider audience. The conference will offer a platform for all three stakeholder groups to deliberate on gaps, opportunities, and strategies to enrich science reporting.

Growing the field of science journalism
Science journalism is gaining traction in Africa, but it remains behind other fields of journalism. Politics and business, for example, receive more prominence and coverage in newsrooms. This conference will offer a great opportunity for more than 100 journalists from Kenya, and another 10 journalists from countries in the region, where science journalism is weak. Over the course of the conference, they will interact, share experiences, and acquire skills in the field of science reporting.","False","False","Transaction",,"idrccrdi","CA"

Allt eftersom ad inskrivning i primärskolan har stabiliserats på hög nivå har frågan om kvalitet i undervisning och lärande fått ytterligare uppmärksamhet och det har blivit allt mer uppenbart att utbildningssystemet i allmänhet inte ger barn och ungdomar de färdigheter som de behöver för att bli produktiva samhällsmedborgare. Detta har bekräftats i flera studier på senare år genomförda av såväl enskilda organisationer som multilaterala biståndsorganisationer.
I takt med att kvalitetsfrågorna har fått allt större tyngd i den kambodjanska utbildningsdiskursen har de fått större genomslag i den kambodjanska regeringens utbildningspolicy och de första stegen för att skapa ett system för kvalitetsövervakning har tagits. En ny avdelning för inspektion (Inspectorate General  IG) har skapats vid ministeriet för utbildning, ungdom och sport (Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports - MoEYS) som har övergripande ansvar för kvalitetsövervakning för grundskola och gymnasienivå och för att rapportera till den centrala ledningen för MoEYS. IG är fortfarande en mycket liten avdelning med stort kapacitetsunderskott och oklart mandat.
Det system för inspektion och kvalitetsövervakning som nu finns för grundutbildning i Kambodja fokuserar på skolbyggnader och materiel och granskar endast i mycket begränsad omfattning andra faktorer som är viktiga för att förstå kvalitetsnivån på undervisning och lärande. Till skillnad från examinationer mäter inspektions- och kvalitetssäkringssystem i internationell betydelse såväl färdigheter i skolämnen som de processer som styr undervisning och lärande men har också som syfte att hjälpa skolor och utbildningssystem att genomföra förbättringar. Inspektions- och kvalitetssäkringssystem gör det också möjligt att systematiskt mäta undervisningens mera komplexa läroprocesser som är svåra eller omöjliga att mäta genom examinationer.
Den föreslagna av insatsen har som syfte att förstärka de steg som har tagits under de första åren av genomförandet för att bygga och förstärka ett tydlig och omfattande inspektions- och kvalitetssäkringssystem för förskola och grundläggande utbildning. Genom den föreslagna förlängningen förväntas den allmänna förståelsen för vikten av kvalitetssäkring i utbildningen och den dubbla rollen av kontroll och stöd att öka inom MoEYS på såväl central som decentraliserad nivå, liksom att inspektions- och kvalitetssäkringssystemet kommer att ha en tydligare och mer sammanhängande struktur inom ministeriet och att kapacitet att genomföra inspektioner förstärks, inte minst för de lokala myndigheterna som ansvarar för uppföljning och stöd mot skolorna.","True","True","Transaction",,"sida","SE"

There have been many attempts to control malaria in sub-Saharan Africa through health sector interventions (case diagnosis, management and prevention), vector control (larvicide, insecticide and environmentally based mosquito control), reduction of human-vector contact (bednets) and public education. These initiatives have been effective in several regions of Asia, southern Europe and Latin America, but less so in Africa. This is attributed to the extent of malaria prevalence on the continent, the efficiency of the vector (primarily Anopheles funestus and A. arabiensis), and highly variable social, environmental and economic determinants of the disease.

It is increasingly recognized that effective solutions to the problem will require a combination of tools. The Integrated Program on Malaria in sub-Saharan Africa (IPMA) will offer a shared and synergistic approach to existing malaria control programs. It will do so by supporting research aimed at understanding the complex societal and environmental dynamics affecting malaria in the region, and testing interventions that respond to both specific local factors and large-scale forces.

A budget revision (BR) was approved in December 2014 to extend this PRRO for another three months until March 2015, thus allowing WFP to continue providing food assistance in Central Mindanao as a bridging period to the subsequent PRRO 200743, which commenced in April 2015. The three-month extension ensured an uninterrupted realignment of WFP's programme strategy for the region alongside the ongoing government planning and the Mindanao peace process. Another BR was approved in 2015 to provide cash assistance to the people affected by Typhoon Hagupit in Eastern Visayas.","False","False","Budget",2,"wfp","wfp"

The project is designed to use the findings of its applied research to influence national and regional policy affecting the African rice industry to ensure that agricultural policy considers the needs of all rice agricultural stakeholders, especially local farmers.   Rice is the most rapidly growing source of food in Africa. Both urban and rural populations have come to depend on it as a food staple that is easy to prepare, store and provides a high source of calories, making it an essential complement to good nutrition. In 2010, Africans consumed an estimated 26 million tons of rice, with an average per capita consumption rate of 24 kg per year. The formal African rice industry with its limited means for production is not able to meet this consumer demand with a yearly production of 16 million tons of rice.

WFP's humanitarian assistance included the provision of food or cash-based transfers (CBT) to internally displaced persons (IDPs) and returnees affected by conflict, to people affected by economic stress or natural disasters, such as floods and landslides, as well as for the treatment of acutely malnourished children under five years of age and pregnant and lactating women (PLW). According to the Afghanistan National Nutrition Survey (NNS) 2013, 40.9 percent of children under five were chronically malnourished (stunted), 9.5 percent were acutely malnourished (wasted) and 24.6 percent underweight. 

The context of maternal and child nutrition status is characterised by a high prevalence of malnutrition, including micronutrient deficiencies, due to inadequate dietary intake, frequent infections and poor maternal outcomes. Maternal undernutrition is equally concerning with one-fifth of adolescent girls and women of reproductive age undernourished (low body mass index). Underweight women are more likely to give birth to low birthweight babies at higher risk of neonatal and infant death and stunted growth. The NNS 2013 showed that women and adolescent girls who had little or no formal education or came from impoverished households were more likely to be malnourished and deficient in essential micronutrients.

As part of its recovery strategy, WFP supported communities in their efforts to build productive assets that increase agricultural productivity and strengthen resilience to shocks. Additionally, WFP's recovery activities contributed to increased enrolment, attendance and learning capacity among primary and lower secondary school pupils through take-home rations, and among adults, particularly women, through vocational skills training activities.

Aligned with WFP Strategic Objectives 1, 2 and 4, the PRRO aimed to:

- respond to the food security and nutritional needs of IDPs and returnees affected by conflict, and people affected by natural disasters and economic stress (under Strategic Objective 1); 
- support the recovery of communities affected by shocks (under Strategic Objective 2); 
- treat moderately malnourished children under-5 and PLW (under Strategic Objective 4); 
- contribute to learning among primary and lower secondary school pupils and adults, particularly women (under Strategic Objective 4). 

Under capacity development, WFP's Purchase for Progress (P4P) initiative continued to procure locally produced high-energy biscuits (HEB) for emergency response, wheat grain from local small-holder farmer organizations and also to connect farmers with millers in order to create a sustainable institutional market for their surplus. This contributed to WFP's shift to more nutrition-sensitive entitlement baskets in mid-2015. WFP facilitated capacity development events for government staff, farmers and national counterparts. Training included major disaster response simulation exercises, with a focus on emergency preparedness and response capacity, food security analysis and disaster risk reduction (DRR).

It can be caused by development projects, conflict, or natural disasters. It is a traumatic process because it can involve loss of housing, income, livelihoods, assets, and access to natural resources. This research project will examine the interplay between involuntary displacement, violence, inequality, and poverty on re-settled populations living in urban communities.

The project will seek to identify and, where possible, quantify the links between the violence of forced displacement and the level of poverty and inequality. Researchers will investigate these linkages in two cities in Sri Lanka (Colombo and Jaffna) and one city in India (Cochin) where urban displacement and resettlement are significant issues.

There is limited information on how displaced people cope with the risks associated with accommodation, eviction, nutrition, the basic needs of women and children, legal status, and protection at urban locations. The lack of context-based household survey data has hindered the process of:
- counting the numbers of those affected;
- planning strategies to help them; and, 
- creating evidence-based interventions. 

South Asia has little in the way of studies on the violence, urbanization, and inequality experienced by displaced people in urban contexts. The state, private sector, and international aid agencies have been unable to cope with the massive influx of displaced people into cities. It is therefore essential to develop evidence-based strategies to help those trying to rebuild their lives.

This study will target returned, resettled, and relocated people following development-induced or conflict-induced displacement. It will look at their urban host communities which have been mostly spared from displacement. Researchers will conduct an extensive literature review. They will also conduct a quantitative and qualitative survey to document the impact of violence on settlers in the fragile post-war reality of Sri Lanka and the relatively stable reality of Cochin, India.

This project is part of the Safe and Inclusive Cities (SAIC) research initiative designed to build an evidence base on the connections between urban violence, poverty, and inequalities. Jointly funded by IDRC and the United Kingdom's Department for International Development, the SAIC program also seeks to identify the most effective strategies for addressing these challenges in Latin America and the Caribbean, South Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa.

The program is designed to provide timely transfers of food or cash to beneficiaries during certain periods of the year when food is not readily available. As a result, the beneficiaries do not have to sell their limited assets (livestock, farm implements) in order to survive until the next growing season.   The beneficiaries receive the food or cash in exchange for their labour on small, community-based, public works projects that contribute to the well-being of the community involved. These projects are chosen by the communities and may include activities such as: (i) terracing and planting trees to improve soil conservation and restore degraded watersheds, so that more land can become agriculturally productive; (ii) small-scale water collection and irrigation initiatives to provide water sources during the growing season, thus decreasing the chance of losing crops due to limited rainfall; or (iii) the construction of community infrastructure such as rural roads to enable farmers to go to and from markets, schools for children to enhance their future economic opportunities, or health centres so that people can become and remain healthy in order to be contributing members in their community. Food is also provided directly to eligible beneficiaries who, due to personal circumstances, are unable to provide labour for public works. These include orphans, pregnant and lactating women, households with only elderly residents, young children and mothers in female-headed households, and people living with HIV/AIDS.

This reliance is unsustainable. As governments are facing increased pressure to move to greener modes of production, consumption is increasing. Both issues present new challenges to developing countries. This project will look at how small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) will manage this transformation.

SMEs are responsible for the largest share of jobs in developing countries. An environmental, or greening, approach to production can put SMEs and jobs at risk. However, new industries and productive sectors may emerge too, generating new jobs. Though there is growing knowledge about the implications of going green, reliable analysis and data are limited. There are also opposing views on the likely impact going green will have on employment, and SME competitiveness and survival.

This project will carry out applied research on the challenge and opportunities that going green offer to SMEs in Peru and Argentina. Specifically, it will aim to generate findings on the main impacts of better environmental practices on employment, labour conditions, productivity, performance, and the creation of new green markets in Buenos Aires and Lima.

Researchers will analyze firms' greening experiences in both locales using surveys, interviews, and case studies. Their findings will:
-generate new knowledge about different models of sustainable practices; 
-assess the impact of going green on employment and productivity for firms participating in clean production programs;
-provide evidence of whether or not new green markets develop out of the greening process; and, 
-promote a policy debate on alternative models of greener practices in SMEs.

The research will also shed light on the role of public policies in fostering or impeding the adoption of green business practices. It will help promote policy debates on alternative models of environmental transformation in SMEs, taking their expected impacts on employment and development into account.","False","False","Transaction",,"idrccrdi","CA"

Despite increased openness to evidence-based policymaking, local funding for Latin American policy research institutions is extremely limited and often partisan. Except in Peru (and universities in general), policy research organizations are relatively young and face challenges common to newly established institutions anywhere: difficulties in establishing a focused research agenda, problems in attracting and retaining staff and governance issues.

This grant will strengthen the ability of the 12 selected research institutions to provide, disseminate and communicate high-quality research. This will be achieved through measures aimed at enhancing the ability of staff to conduct sound research, improving organizational governance, and communicating with policymakers. Particular effort will be made to enable grantees to mobilize other sources of funding, so that none become dependent on the Think Tank Initiative over the long term.

Aligned with United Nations Joint Vision for Sierra Leone and WFP Strategic Objectives 2, and 4 of the Strategic Results Framework, the CP focused on increasing access to basic education, improving nutrition, and livelihood. The CP, with the exception of food and nutritional support to ART clients and their households, was put on hold in June 2014 when the Ebola outbreak prevented large gatherings and resulted in movement restrictions and a collapse of non-Ebola related health services. WFP was not able to resume the majority of the CP activities due to the continued presence of the virus through most of 2015 and the ongoing discussion with government over programme resumption and implementation. 

Improving the quality of and access to education are priorities of the government under pillar three of the Agenda for Prosperity (A4P). WFP aimed to support this pillar through component 1 of the CP, the school feeding programme. In order to bridge the gender gap, the CP intended to provide a take home ration as an incentive for parents to send their girls to school and to keep them there.  The school feeding programme and take home ration was not resumed in 2015 due to ongoing discussions with the government for the roll-out of a government-led national school feeding programme. 

Overall, the population of Sierra Leone has a poor nutritional status attributable to the high levels of stunting and micronutrient deficiencies at varying levels across the country. Component 2 of the CP intended to focus on providing nutritional support to malnourished and vulnerable children aged 6-59 months, pregnant and lactating women (PLW) through targeted supplementary feeding, ART clients and their households through targeted supplementary feeding, and complementary feeding for children aged 6-23 months. Supplementary feeding through health centers for moderately acute malnourished children and PLW was significantly disrupted as capacity to provide healthcare services outside of Ebola was unavailable, combined with community fear of health facilities. In November, the targeted supplementary feeding programme (TSFP) was resumed and expanded under the CP to include both children age 6-59 months and pregnant and lactating women (PLW). Complementary feeding was removed under the Budget Revision as other nutrition interventions were considered to have a larger impact and greater coverage. 

Despite the suspension of the CP activities, malnourished ART clients continued to receive food-by-prescription while their families received household food support.  This helped to ensure that this already vulnerable group continued to receive support throughout the Ebola outbreak so that ART adherence and nutritional status was maintained. 

In order to address the poor infrastructure which continues to threaten food security, the CP aimed to build agricultural assets and helped to achieve adequate food consumption levels mostly through the Cash for Assets (CFA) programme. As agriculture is a core pillar in the A4P and the government's Poverty Reduction Strategy for 2013-2018, the CP supported agricultural growth through component 5 of the government's Smallholder Commercialization Programme. However, like other CP activities, the livelihoods component was put on hold from June 2014 due to the Ebola outbreak and was not resumed in 2015.","False","False","Budget",2,"wfp","wfp"

Vulnerable households in the South, South-East, North, North-East, North-West, West and Artibonite Departments are affected by food insecurity due to the combination of failing harvest and rising food prices. With very high levels of chronic food insecurity, the impact of El Nino is to increase the number of acutely food insecure and malnourished people. At the end of 2015 some 37 communes were in phase 3 of IPC, and this number further increased in early 2016. The influx of over 50,000 people of Haitian descent from the Dominican Republic has aggravated the humanitarian situation and has pressurized scarce water and food supplies along the border. In addition, frequent cholera outbreaks further contribute to acute malnutrition. With increased figures of acute malnutrition in the Western region, particularly in the Fonds Verrettes communes where the GAM rate is 27.7%, the highest among the 20 communes assessed in Dec 2015 by UNICEF, the proposed action aims to address the critical needs linked to the nutritional status of vulnerable groups.

A one-year mentorship model that allows for highly engaged support and continual learning, the program will enable TTI grantees to customize their own capacity development with the support and ongoing input of a mentor. Mentoring will be flexible to respond to the particular needs of each funded institution. Specifically, the program will provide support in the following areas:
- understanding policy processes in specific contexts; 
- engaging in knowledge brokering; 
- contributing to public debate; and, 
- synthesizing and packaging knowledge and evidence.

The PEC program will also emphasize peer learning between TTI-funded institutions with common synergies. This model aims to encourage a learning-by-doing approach where think tanks enhance policy engagement and communications by sharing best practices with peers, adjusting, and innovating to suit the specific context. Although the program strives for a balance between individualized institutional and group-focused support, the appropriate support ratio will be based on the needs and interests of TTI-funded think tanks in each region.

Beslutet tas i enlighet med Sidas insatshanteringsregel paragraf 3.11.3. 

Sida beslutar om multi-bi stöd (som komplement till regeringens årliga kärnbidrag) baserat på FNs konsoliderade appeller (Humanitarian Response Plans), UNHCRs Global Appeal och UNHCRs tilläggsbudgetar (Supplementary Appeals) samt Regionala flyktingappeller (Regional Refugee Response Plans). Sida allokerar bidraget till UNHCR på land/region nivå och stödet är oöronmärkt på denna nivå. Sida har under året även möjlighet att ta ställning till ytterligare stöd genom tilläggsbeslut. 

Genom detta stöd bidrar Sida med humanitär finansiering till UNHCR för att bistå flyktingar och internflyktingar i väpnade konflikter så att dessa får skydd mot förföljelse och våld, tak över huvudet och basförnödenheter, samt möjligheter till varaktiga lösningar när situationen så tillåter. UNHCR ansvarar för att leda och samordna det globala klustret för skydd, samt klustren för lägerkoordinering och nödlogi i situationer med väpnad konflikt och bidrar därmed till strategisk samordning inom det humanitära systemet, både på global- och landnivå. Stödet omfattar både nya akuta humanitära situationer, eskalerande kriser, liksom utdragna flyktingsituationer och inkluderar insatser inom sektorerna skydd, nödlogi (shelter) och multi-sektorn (vilket omfattar hälsa, nutrition, livsmedel, utbildning, vatten och sanitet).

Landfördelningen 2017 omfattar totalt 165 000 000 SEK med stöd till: 
Algeriet (Sahrawi flyktingar) 5 000 000 SEK; Burundi/Rwanda 5 000 000 SEK; Democratiska Republiken Kongo 10 000 000 SEK; Etiopien 8 000 000 SEK; Irak 14 000 000 SEK; Libyen 5 000 000 SEK; Mali-situationen 8 000 000 SEK; Somalia-situationen 10 000 000 SEK; Sydsudan 15 000 000 SEK; Sudan 10 000 000 SEK; Syrien 15 000 000 SEK; Syrien-situationen 30 000 000 SEK; Ukraina 10 000 000 SEK; Jemen 15 000 000 SEK, Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV) strategi implementering (globalt) 
5 000 000 SEK. 

Sida bedömer att samtliga medel för 2017 ska utbetalas i början av året för att UNHCR ska ges förutsättningar att planera och genomföra humanitära insatser utan fördröjning. UNHCR omsätter regelmässigt utbetalda medel i nära anslutning till utbetalning och förbrukar gåvomedel inom verksamhetsåret. Ett avsteg från Sidas vanliga rutiner om uppdelade betalningar bedöms motiverat.

UNHCR har uppdaterat sin policy för administrativa kostnader (Programme Support Cost PSC) genom ett internt beslut, efter konsultation med givarna. Beslutet har fattats av UNHCRs Högkommissarie den 31 december 2015 och gäller för bidrag från och med 1 januari 2016. Sidas stöd kommer att debiteras 7% administrationsavgift eftersom endast helt oöronmärkta stöd, så som det svenska kärnstödet från UD, kommer att undantas. UD har i konsultationsprocessen lämnat sitt stöd till denna policyförändring, då denna kan främja oöronmärkta stöd och en stärkt översynsförmåga vilket är kan gynnar oallokerade medel i enlighet med svensk linje. Genom detta beslut föreslås en avtalsändring av ramavtalet med UNHCR (sk General Agreement) i syfte att uppdatera villkoren vad gäller nivån på administrativa kostnader.

Aligned with United Nations Joint Vision for Sierra Leone and WFP Strategic Objectives 2, and 4 of the Strategic Results Framework, the CP focused on increasing access to basic education, improving nutrition, and livelihood. The CP, with the exception of food and nutritional support to ART clients and their households, was put on hold in June 2014 when the Ebola outbreak prevented large gatherings and resulted in movement restrictions and a collapse of non-Ebola related health services. WFP was not able to resume the majority of the CP activities due to the continued presence of the virus through most of 2015 and the ongoing discussion with government over programme resumption and implementation. 

Improving the quality of and access to education are priorities of the government under pillar three of the Agenda for Prosperity (A4P). WFP aimed to support this pillar through component 1 of the CP, the school feeding programme. In order to bridge the gender gap, the CP intended to provide a take home ration as an incentive for parents to send their girls to school and to keep them there.  The school feeding programme and take home ration was not resumed in 2015 due to ongoing discussions with the government for the roll-out of a government-led national school feeding programme. 

Overall, the population of Sierra Leone has a poor nutritional status attributable to the high levels of stunting and micronutrient deficiencies at varying levels across the country. Component 2 of the CP intended to focus on providing nutritional support to malnourished and vulnerable children aged 6-59 months, pregnant and lactating women (PLW) through targeted supplementary feeding, ART clients and their households through targeted supplementary feeding, and complementary feeding for children aged 6-23 months. Supplementary feeding through health centers for moderately acute malnourished children and PLW was significantly disrupted as capacity to provide healthcare services outside of Ebola was unavailable, combined with community fear of health facilities. In November, the targeted supplementary feeding programme (TSFP) was resumed and expanded under the CP to include both children age 6-59 months and pregnant and lactating women (PLW). Complementary feeding was removed under the Budget Revision as other nutrition interventions were considered to have a larger impact and greater coverage. 

Despite the suspension of the CP activities, malnourished ART clients continued to receive food-by-prescription while their families received household food support.  This helped to ensure that this already vulnerable group continued to receive support throughout the Ebola outbreak so that ART adherence and nutritional status was maintained. 

In order to address the poor infrastructure which continues to threaten food security, the CP aimed to build agricultural assets and helped to achieve adequate food consumption levels mostly through the Cash for Assets (CFA) programme. As agriculture is a core pillar in the A4P and the government's Poverty Reduction Strategy for 2013-2018, the CP supported agricultural growth through component 5 of the government's Smallholder Commercialization Programme. However, like other CP activities, the livelihoods component was put on hold from June 2014 due to the Ebola outbreak and was not resumed in 2015.","False","False","Budget",2,"wfp","wfp"

This paper is the restructuring of the project to reallocate funds between categories of expenditure. The reallocation will transfer funds from categories, including capitation payments for primary health care services in the Northern, Central, Patagonia and Cuyo regions and for consultant services. The project's overall implementation progress is moderately satisfactory. As of October 2011, the number of beneficiaries of plan Nacer program was around 1.71 million, representing 84.3 percent of the eligible population, exceeding the end of project target of 80 percent. In addition, the percentage of affiliated health providers was over 87 percent and annual performance agreements were implemented successfully in all participating provinces; both indicators are above the end of project targets. The reallocation is necessary to: ensure adequate support to the provision of the basic health service package and the implementation of an action plan for increasing the feasibility of achieving the related health outcome indicators targets by the end of project implementation in all participating provinces; ensure an efficient use of loan resources; and support the adequate performance of the program and project implementation units.","False","False","Budget",2,"worldbank","ida"

Second, the reduced effective implementation period of 2.5 years has proved to be insufficient to complete the investment cycle for many community subprojects financed under the loan. Third, while the loan is fully disbursed, subproject implementation has lagged, largely due to the protracted Effectiveness delay. The community subproject cycle, from transfer of funds to the community association's account until implementation is complete and the expenditures are verify, is a period of 9-12 months.
