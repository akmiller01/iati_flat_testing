This project will explore ways of stimulating and scaling up the innovations of small-scale farmers. In collaboration with stakeholders, researchers will examine instances of scaled-up innovation in farm production, natural resource management and off-farm income generation and develop policies and programs in consequence.

Forum Syd har inkommit med en ansökan om rambidrag 2017 om sammanlagt 219 774 000 SEK. Ansökan avser en ettårig förlängning av det program som genomförs under avtalsperioden 2014-2016. Det ansökta beloppet är totalt ca 31 MSEK (17 procent) högre än den genomsnittliga årliga rambidraget i det nuvarande avtalet, vilket motiveras av en ökning av projekt och program som Forum Syd bedömt vara relevanta. De tolv nya fleråriga program som ingår i ansökan står för den största delen av ökningen. 
 
Sida bedömer att den föreslagna verksamheten är relevant och att Forum Syd och de organisationer de vidareförmedlar medel till har kapacitet att genomföra verksamheten. Normalt beviljar Sida inte större ökningar av det årliga rambidraget i samband med ettåriga förlängningar. Sida beslutar emellertid att bevilja Forum Syd 210 000 000 SEK för verksamheten 2017. Skälen för denna ökning är följande:
 
• Den nya CSO-strategin, som beslutades i juni 2016, speglar regeringens tydliga prioritering gällande ökad mångfald inom anslaget både avseende mångfald av CSO i Sverige och i utvecklingsländer. Forum Syd vidareförmedlar medel till en stor bredd av svenska civilsamhällesaktörer och dessa samarbetar med en mångfald av CSO i utvecklingsländer. Forum Syds vidareförmedling bidrar således i hög grad till mångfald.
• Antalet svenska organisationer som bedömts ha tillräcklig kapacitet att bedriva större och fleråriga program har ökat från nio under nuvarande avtalsperiod till 19. En bidragande orsak till detta är Forum Syds kapacitetsutveckling. Ansökan innehåller fleråriga program för tolv av dessa organisationer. Sida bedömer att programformen är en biståndseffektiv finansieringsform och att programmen skapar goda förutsättningar för ett långsiktigt stöd till partnerorganisationerna i utvecklingsländer
• För att Forum Syd ska fortsätta bidra till mångfalden i anslaget är det viktigt att de även framöver kan vara öppna för nya organisationer och att små projekt kan växa. För att detta ska vara möjligt måste det finnas utrymme i budgeten. Givet att ett större belopp än tidigare går till fleråriga program finns ett behov att öka det totala bidraget. 


BAKGRUND

1. ANSÖKANDE ORGANISATION
Forum Syd är en medlemsstyrd organisation med för närvarande ca 160 medlemsorganisationer. Forum Syds vision är en rättvis och hållbar värld där alla människor har makt att förändra. För att uppnå visionen arbetar Forum Syd med följande verksamhet; 1) vidareförmedling av medel från CSO-anslaget till svenska enskilda organisationer (Forum Syds term för dessa är SvEO) och deras samarbetspartners i utvecklingsländer (Forum Syds term för dessa är LEO (lokala enskilda organisationer)) , 2) genomförande av egna program med finansiering från bland annat andra anslag från Sida och svenska ambassader och EU-kommissionen och 3) utgöra en plattform för biståndsaktörer i det svenska civila samhället och bedriva opinionsarbete för en rättvis och hållbar utveckling, 4) vidareförmedling av medel från INFOKOM-anslaget till svenska enskilda organisationer. Den aktuella ansökan avser det första verksamhetsområdet. 

Forum Syd har varit ramorganisation och förmedlat Sida-stöd till svenska enskilda organisationers utvecklingssamarbete sedan 1995. Forum Syds främsta mervärde för genomförandet av CSO-strategin är att en stor bredd av SvEO ges möjlighet att ansöka om medel från CSO-anslaget genom organisationens vidareförmedlingsverksamhet. Forum Syd är öppna för organisationer med olika tematiskt fokus, små och stora organisationer, olika organisationsformer och organisationer som representerar en bredd av aktörer i det svenska civilsamhället. Det stora antalet SvEO och bredden bland dessa bidrar också i stor utsträckning till att CSO-anslaget når en mångfald av lokala samarbetsorganisationer i utvecklingsländer. Det som gör Forum Syd unik bland Sidas ramorganisationer är att de förmedlar pengar inte enbart till egna medlemmar utan även till icke-medlemmar som inte","True","True","Budget",,"SE-0-SE-6-5403043302-KEN-15150","SE"

It will provide funds for the Second Regional Conference of the Latin America Research Initiative on Public Policies (ILAIPP). ILAIPP is funded under the Think Tank Initiative (TTI).

Held in Lima, Peru, in March 2016, the conference aims to foster evidence-based debate on the topic of education, which is of significant interest in Latin America. The theme is Quality and Innovation in Education.

About the Think Tank Initiative
TTI is a multi-funder program dedicated to strengthening independent policy research institutions, or think tanks, in developing countries. The program aims to enhance their ability to provide sound research that informs and influences policy. 

This second TTI phase (2014-2019) will fund 43 institutions, helping them consolidate their role as credible development actors in their countries, and in some cases, regionally and internationally.

Skills, knowledge, action
TTI's Phase 2 capacity development plan includes global and regional learning events that create space for think tanks to share experiences and identify opportunities to innovate collaboratively. These events aim to generate knowledge, ideas, and action. Regional conferences present a unique space to cultivate new ideas and practices through engagement with TTI-funded think tanks, other think tanks, universities, experts, donors, and policymakers. 

The conference is a key opportunity for ILAIPP to gain visibility as a go-to source of research evidence, data, and analysis for policymakers in the region. 

Quality and innovation in education
The conference's theme is particularly relevant given the widespread increase in education enrollment in recent years. This increase has strained education systems in the region. The search is on for innovative solutions that provide quality education to increasing numbers of students.

Through investments in applied research, the CIFSRF contributes to the development of more productive, sustainable, and gender-sensitive agricultural techniques for women subsistence farmers, with the ultimate goal of making food sources more secure and accessible, and the food produced more nutritious, for poor households. Women and girls are particularly targeted by this project since they face the heaviest burden of chronic hunger and malnutrition in developing countries.  The objectives of the CIFSRF are: (1) to increase food security in developing countries by funding applied research in agricultural development and nutrition; (2) to apply Canadian science and technology expertise in collaboration with developing country partners to address food security; (3) to use research results to inform food security policies and programs; and (4) to identify innovations and scale up the most promising research from both Phase I and Phase II of the Fund to help meet future global food demand. Phase II focuses geographically on the 20 countries already targeted under Phase I as well as all other official development assistance-eligible countries in Africa.  Project activities for phase II include: (1) developing farming methods that can better withstand the effects of climate change; (2) developing environmentally sustainable gender-sensitive, farmer-led research models for breeding and distribution of new crops or underutilized traditional crops and consumption of sufficient, safe and nutritious food; (3) improving family-based aquaculture; (4) decreasing domestic animal losses through development of vaccines; and (5) reducing post-harvest losses through adaptable and affordable technologies.  Partnership is an important aspect of the CIFSRF and all the research projects funded are jointly conducted by Canadian and developing country-based organizations, such as academic institutions, private sector organizations, civil society organizations, or research institutions.

Many countries experienced explosive increase of HIV from the epidemic of Injecting Drug Users (IDU). To a large degree, due to the activities supported by the grant this did not occur in Bangladesh. 

IDUs and Female Sex Workers (FSWs) are the focus of the grant. At the end of Phase 1 of the RCC Grant (December 2011), the performance of the grant against its targets was considered satisfactory. The average performance on the Top 10 indicators was 96% (A2). All indicators rating was at 98% (A2). Out of 14 Service Delivery Area indicators, 6 were overachieved, 5 were between 90-100%; two indicators were slightly below 90% and one - ""Number of IDU and FSW reached through Peer Education"" - was at 68% and rapidly catching up from the previous level of 50%. 

The underachievement was partially due to the discontinuation of a Sub-Recipient (SR) agreement in September 2011 with an entity that was ensuring the coverage of up to one-third of IDU targets. The discontinuation of this SR agreement followed an investigation by the Global Fund’s Office of the Inspector General which found disturbing signs of fraudulent practices by the SR. 

The PR acted decisively in order to safeguard the Global Fund money and took over the direct implementation of IDU-related activities. As a result, the PR managed to maintain the expected return of the grant by avoiding the prolonged discontinuation of preventive activities for IDUs, while at the same time reducing further risk.

Overall, it is expected that a good level of performance will be maintained throughout the time remaining until the end of Phase 1 (in November 30, 2012) and, pending the Phase 2 approval, beyond Phase 1.""

1. Background and Summary:  

With estimated HIV prevalence of less than 0.1% (2009 UNAIDS Country Brief), Bangladesh is a low HIV prevalence country. UNAIDS estimates about 12,000 people in Bangladesh to be living with HIV at the end of 2007. As of December 2008, a total of 1495 cases of HIV infection were confirmed, with 476 of them developing AIDS and 165 reported death cases (National HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan). The Sero Surveillance Report findings show that HIV infection rate is increasing among most-at-risk-population (MARP), particularly among injecting drug users (IDUs) with concentrated epidemic in Dhaka (7%), and among female sex workers (FSW) due to low level of condom use.

Despite the low HIV prevalence in Bangladesh, several risk factors, including geographical location, high population mobility, a large number of migrant workers, poverty, and low level of awareness among young people threaten to hamper the continuing status of Bangladesh as a low HIV prevalence country. The HIV Joint Monitoring Mission organized by the World Bank and its key partners in February 2009 found that prompt and vigorous action is needed to strengthen the quality and coverage of HIV prevention programs, particularly amongst IDUs. HIV/AIDS Program in Bangladesh is part of the Health, Nutrition and Population Sector Program (HNPSP), which addresses the Millennium Development Goals and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) through a pool of multiple funding and donor consortia.

The main objectives of the Global Fund-financed HIV/AIDS Rolling Continuation Chanel (RCC) Program are: 

1. Increasing the scale of prevention services for key populations at higher risk (IDUs, FSW, hijras (transgender population) and men having sex with men (MSM));
2. Increasing the scale of the most effective activities conducted with the Global Fund Round 2  HIV/AIDS Program; and
3. Building capacity of partners in order to increase the scale of the national response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

The Program objectives complement the continuation and scaling up of relevant interventions from the Global Fund-financed Round 2 HIV/AIDS Program (BAN-202-G01-H-00) in the major areas of behavior change communication (BCC) using mass media, HIV and AIDS information in formal and non-formal educational institutions, advocacy to create an enabling environment, and capacity building for implementers. In addition, they include new interventions resulting from the change in scope and scale of activities under the Round 2 Program, i.e. harm reduction services for IDUs, prevention services for FSW working in the streets, hotels and residences, prevention services for hijras and MSM, and national capacity building, including improvement of national monitoring and evaluation system.  
This RCC Program will be implemented by three principal recipients: Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of the Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh (the ""Principal Recipient""), Save the Children USA, and the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Diseases Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR’B).

2016,"bilateral-unspecified",10,,110,"B03",3796282.0163,"UN-Habitat 2016-2019",430,43030,,"Enheten för Global Ekonomi och Miljö (GECO) föreslår härmed att Sida bör stödja UN-Habitat med 134 MSEK för perioden 2016-2019 (32 MSEK/år för 2016-2017 och 35 MSEK/år för 2018-2019). Stödet innebär en ökning från nuvarande nivå om 25 MSEK/år för perioden 2012-2015. Detta motiveras främst av att relevansen av UN-Habitat's verksamhet har ökat då urbana frågor får allt större genomslag och då skrivningen om hållbar utveckling av städer i den innevarande strategin är tydligare än tidigare strategi samt att Sidas stöd till UN-Habitat inte förändrats sedan 2009 då INTEM nuvarande form för övergripande (sk 'Framework agreement') finansiellt stöd inleddes samt att insatsen är minst lika relevant som tidigare. 

UD har gett kärnstöd till UN-Habitat om 11 MSEK/år fram tom 2014 men detta stöd upphörde förra året. UD har dock inte ännu tagit ett formellt beslut om att upphöra med stödet. UDs stöd har dock inte samma syfte som Sidas medel då deras medel består av kärnstöd som skall användas för övergripande internationella och andra processer, medan Sidas stöd används till projektverksamhet. Utöver Sida/GECOs stöd, så finns även avtal mellan UN-Habitat och Sidas bilaterala kontor för Kenya. Fram tom 2014 gav Sida ett omfattande stöd till UN-Habitat för ett projekt om stadsplanering i Kosovo. Detta projekt har varit mycket framgångsrikt men Sida bedömer nu att det inte finns anledning att fortsätta denna verksamhet.

Sidas stöd har tidigare utgått för genomförande av ett begränsat antal fokusområden inom UN-Habitats egen strategi, Strategic Plan avseende (SP) 2014-2019 och Medium-Term Strategic Implementation Plan (MTSIP) för 2008-2013. Stöd har främst utgått till projekt som Global Land Tool Network, Safer Cities, flera projekt inom fysisk planering, urban lagstiftning samt till övergripande processer som transparans (Open UN-Habitat), revisioner, utvärderingar, 'governance', reformer av det finansiella systemet, demokrati och mänskliga rättigheter samt utvecklande av resultatramverk. Den huvudsakliga inriktningen på Sidas stöd avses fortsätta även framgent (se projektförslag i bilaga). Dock har SP exempelvis mindre fokus på fysisk planering än MTSIP vilket föranleder vissa förändringar i inriktningen.

Det föreslås här att Sida framöver skall ha ett något mer riktat till specifika tematiska fokusområden i Strategic Plan än stödet för 2012-2015. Detta motiveras av den nuvarande situationen i UN-Habitat. UN-Habitat har under flera år fått minskade kärnbidrag (men tvärtom utökad finansiering av projektverksamhet). Flera viktiga givare har slutat att finansiera organisationen med kärnstöd på global nivå men fortsatt med riktat stöd (tex Storbritanien och Nederländerna). De minskande kärnbidragen beror främst på ett missnöje över bristande reformarbete inom UN-Habitat övergripande styrning med för många beslutande instanser och misskött handledning/handäggning av övergripande internationella processer såsom exvis arrangemanget av större internationella konferenser. Utökad andel av budgeten för projektfinansiering har inneburit att UN-Habitats normativa verksamhet har minskat i omfattning och den operativa verksamheten ökat. 

Trots personalnedskärningar för normativ verksamhet under senare år, så bedömer Sida att UN-Habitat fortfarande bör ha en tillräckligt stor kader skickliga medarbetare och relevant verksamhet för att motivera fortsatt stöd men minskade kärnbidrag har inneburit att handläggarna på UN-Habitat ägnar en större andel av sin arbetstid till att finna projektfinansiering. Det har därför blivit en större och dessutom olämplig konkurrens internt på UN-Habitat om Sidas medel. 

Samtliga projekt som Sida avser stödja ryms inom Strategic Plan för 2014-2019 som också omfattar ett resultatramverk.

This question is at the heart of a research project designed to support climate-resilient economic development in semi-arid lands. It will do so by addressing the conditions for economic growth and considering the needs of women and marginalized groups. 

Leading change on climate change adaptation
Five consortium partners will implement the project in six countries: Burkina Faso, Kenya, Pakistan, Senegal, Tajikistan, and Tanzania. These countries all have large, economically crucial semi-arid lands, where water scarcity shapes ecosystems and social and economic opportunities.

The partners include:
-Overseas Development Institute 
-Innovations
-Environnement et Développement en Afrique
-Center for Climate Change Studies at the University of Dar es Salaam 
-Grantham Research Institute at London School of Economics 
-Sustainable Development Policy Institute

A vision for the future
The consortium's vision of climate-resilient development includes development that tackles poverty and maximizes people's capacity to adapt to climate change, while also expecting that change is needed to implement this vision. The research program is designed to produce evidence that will support this change. 

Research methodology
The research will identify:
-different enabling factors of economic development;
-where they fail to meet the needs and aspirations of poor and marginalized people;  
-whether they increase people's vulnerability to climate change; and
-which of these key factors might be affected by climate change and how. 

The researchers will take a transdisciplinary approach to assess how to resolve trade-offs between these different dimensions to support climate-resilient development. 

From research to policy
The research results will advise policymakers and decision-makers contemplating uncertain interactions between climate change and economic development in fragile semi-arid lands. The researchers will engage with business leaders, economic ministries, and regional economic communities to create new knowledge and to translate this knowledge into policies and investments. Their goal is to help reduce poverty and strengthen adaptive capacity.","False","False","Transaction",,"XM-DAC-301-2-107643-003","CA"

During 2013, PRRO activities provided a transition from the context of the severe food and nutrition crisis in Niger in 2012 to long-term resilience-building through development of human capital and increased agricultural production. Specifically, the main expected outcomes of this PRRO were: i) reduced level of acute malnutrition among children under 5; ii) improved food consumption for targeted emergency-affected households; and iii) improved food consumption for households in a post-disaster situation targeted with food assistance for assets (FFA).

The government's Plan de developpement economique et sociale (PDES, Economic and Social Development Plan) 2012-2015 aims to manage shocks in the short-term and to define long-term development strategies; it prioritizes food security, good governance, national security and the development of human capital and infrastructure. One element of the PDES is the ""Nigeriens nourrissent les Nigeriens"" initiative (which is also known as ""3N,"" or ""Nigeriens Feeding Nigeriens""). The 3N is a national coordination platform to promote long-term food security and agricultural development. The 3N initiative is the national owner of Renewed Efforts Against Child Hunger and Undernutrition (REACH) and is aligned with the Global Alliance for Resilience. WFP's response is in line with the PDES. Furthermore, WFP carries out its intervention in coordination with humanitarian and development partners under the leadership of the government, including the 3N. 

From 2014, WFP will provide an integrated community-based approach to resilience through improving households' access to assets and food through agricultural development activities; providing a targeted safety net during the lean season to mitigate the effects on lives and livelihoods and extending safety nets to prevent malnutrition; and providing school feeding.","False","False","Transaction",,"XM-DAC-41140-200051","wfp"

Except in Peru (and universities in general), policy research organizations are relatively young and face challenges common to newly established institutions anywhere: difficulties in establishing a focused research agenda, problems in attracting and retaining staff and governance issues.

This grant will strengthen the ability of the 12 selected research institutions to provide, disseminate and communicate high-quality research. This will be achieved through measures aimed at enhancing the ability of staff to conduct sound research, improving organizational governance, and communicating with policymakers. Particular effort will be made to enable grantees to mobilize other sources of funding, so that none become dependent on the Think Tank Initiative over the long term. The project will also support a platform for grantee networking both within the Initiative and with a wider network of institutions engaged in policy-related research.

Given widespread population growth in Africa and the inadequacy of the formal sector in generating employment opportunities for youth, there is a widespread fear that gains in poverty reduction achieved over the past three decades may be reversed by the phenomenon of jobless economic growth. The unemployment picture is aggravated by the large number of youth engaged in poor quality and low-paid jobs with intermittent and insecure work. If East African governments are to catch up with the pace at which new young entrants will come onto the job market in the next decade, there is an urgent need to identify innovative ways of generating youth employment. 

Although a number of studies have been undertaken to understand the nature, causes, and impacts of youth unemployment, their linkages to policy have been relatively weak. This project aims to generate innovative approaches and coherent policy messages for generating youth employment and while reducing poverty in East Africa. It combines analysis of household datasets over time with qualitative views from stakeholders such as youth groups, government policymakers, and the donor community in four East African countries (Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and Rwanda). 

From this evidence, researchers will determine the sources of growth and the employment opportunities generated by such growth, as well as the relationship between growth and youth unemployment. They will also examine the effectiveness of existing labour market policies, initiatives, and youth entrepreneurship programs at boosting quality youth employment. Drawing on these findings, the project will aim to inform better policy-making that produces more successful youth entrepreneurship programs.","False","False","Transaction",,"XM-DAC-301-2-107156-003","CA"

They have limited options for sustainable and equitable livelihoods. This project will aim to influence food insecurity by increasing productivity, income, and fish consumption in the area.

Fisheries management and aquaculture farming
Amazon fish are an underused resource that can improve food security options for the poor. This project aims to increase sustainable fisheries management practices in indigenous communities in Bolivia's Amazon basin. It will also expand the aquaculture farms that women primarily manage. 

Researchers from Bolivia and Canada will implement a targeted market and business development strategy. Previous research showed that privately owned small aquaculture ventures could be self-sustained if entrepreneurs have access to technical assistance and financial services. The research team will draw from the private sector's expertise and resources to implement effective business methods and tools, and build targeted financial instruments for smallholders. Family-based businesses will benefit directly from the project through new market opportunities, commercial training, and access to micro-credits.

Increasing production and commercial value
The project will affect different dimensions of food security. It is expected to double the production of paiche (Arapaima gigas), an introduced species with high commercial value. It will also increase aquaculture production (90% pacu and 10% other species) in the project's focus regions. At least 2,200 poor families will increase their income and up to 20,000 people will have a more diverse diet as a result of introducing high-quality fish meat.

Improving governance and financial support
The project team will share research results with its broad network of public and private decision-makers at the local and national levels. Previous research has demonstrated that scaling up takes place within organizational and institutional environments that enable it. 

The project team will act as an advisory platform that feeds into Bolivia's national fishery and aquaculture management policies. This strong partnership of two Canadian institutions and four Bolivian organizations includes universities, NGOs, and private sector organizations.

Other specific objectives include:
-Increase livelihoods through small-scale family-based aquaculture
-Improve fish marketing strategies and enhance fish quality 
-Facilitate a good governance environment for the development of sustainable small-scale fisheries and aquaculture sectors in Bolivia
-Develop and test financial support mechanisms to scale-up small family-based entrepreneurship in fisheries and aquaculture
-Improve understanding of how this work can affect people's livelihoods and food security, and what barriers exist for greater participation among women and the poor

Urbanization has also brought new challenges in the form of conflict, violence, lack of citizen security, and the need for new forms of urban governance. The 2011 World Development Report highlighted violence as a major problem for development. It noted how violence is changing, becoming less structured around situations of civil war and conflict, and is now more focused on civic and social violence. 

The costs of violence on development are substantial and varied. They include direct costs such as the destruction of public infrastructure, personal property and assets, and death and injury. Indirect costs include citizen displacement, the disruption of social services, lower economic growth, brain drain, and higher spending on law enforcement. 

Today's cities are centres of multi-layered violence. Criminal and organized violence, associated with the drug trade in some countries, has become entwined with national politics. Gangs and militias have become a substitute for public authority, offering some protection to communities, but often at great cost. Social violence, including violence within the household, is also a problem, particularly among the poorest, youth, and women living in these environments.","False","False","Transaction",,"XM-DAC-301-2-107016-001","CA"

Access to health care is a basic right guaranteed by the Mexican constitution. However, the decentralization of responsibility for health from the federal to the state level has resulted in a misalignment between power and responsibility on the one hand, and transparency and accountability on the other. As a result, some areas of Mexico - notably the southern states with large indigenous populations - have experienced disproportionately higher health inequities. Maternal mortality rates, for example, are nearly three times higher than the national average in parts of the country with large indigenous populations. 

Addressing these inequities requires strategies for influencing public health policy and garnering political will. Reclaiming transparency and accountability at different levels of government will be central to this process. Civil society organizations (CSOs) can play an important role in helping indigenous women and other vulnerable groups articulate and demand better health services. However, those states with the highest inequities are also among those with the most under-developed civil society.

This research project will examine the role Mexican CSOs play in influencing more equitable public health policies and processes to improve indigenous women's health. Working with researchers, advocacy groups, and different levels of government, it will generate evidence on the nature and extent of CSO involvement and interaction with other stakeholders. The project will develop a theoretical framework for examining CSO strategies, coalitions, tools, and advocacy practices and will support research that analyzes how they can better influence public health policy in Mexico. Workshops and seminars will encourage dialogue and debate, and communicate the findings widely.

The project will generate original research and a shared theoretical framework that can be applied to further study. Peer-reviewed publications, policy briefs, and audio-visual products will communicate findings to different audiences. The research will also raise awareness of the benefits of civil society participation and produce sound evidence that can help build strategic coalitions and influence policy.","False","False","Transaction",,"XM-DAC-301-2-106969-001","CA"

This project aims to extend the harvest and improve fruit quality and shelf life. It builds on an earlier Canadian International Food Security Research Fund project, which demonstrated that hexanal (a widely used biochemical compound) can be a successful tool for addressing the problem. 

Advancing science, enhancing fruit life
The project uses cutting-edge science to extend and optimize the use of hexanal for pre- and post-harvest applications to other commercial fruits, such as bananas, papaya, and citrus. Researchers will improve packaging systems for transporting fruit using hexanal impregnated bionanoparticles and biowax dip treatments. 

The Tamil Nadu Agricultural University in India, the Industrial Technology Institute in Sri Lanka, and the University of Guelph in Canada will work with research institutions in the West Indies, Kenya, and Tanzania to generate new knowledge on innovations with hexanal sprays, biowax, and nanopackaging materials. They will also look at opportunities for commercializing the technologies at scale.

Taking new technologies to market
Research on scaling up will identify suitable, practical methods for wide-scale adoption and market entry. Options include:
-producing nanofibre matrices for commercial use
-applying the technologies to larger volumes of fruits
-packaging for different market requirements
-extending the lessons from mangoes to other tropical fruits

The use of green nanotechnologies from biowastes, instead of metal- or carbon-based nanoparticles, is environmentally sustainable and lowers production costs. 

Improving lives and livelihoods
The project is expected to significantly reduce post-harvest losses, improving incomes and livelihoods for smallholder fruit farmers living in the five target countries. It is also expected to lead to new economic opportunities for women farmers engaged in post-harvest operations.

The main characteristics of the epidemic are:
•	the wide-spread of HIV among various population groups, particularly the most-at-risk groups of injecting drug-users (21.5% mean prevalence with over 40% prevalence in some Oblasts, 2011), female sex workers (7.6% prevalence, 2011), and men who have sex with men (6.4% prevalence, 2011). 
•	the uneven spread of HIV infections in different regions of the country, with 77.1% of officially registered HIV cases in urban areas (Ukraine MOH, 2012). 
•	the shift in dominant routes of HIV infection, from parenteral to sexual transmission (51.1% of persons infected as a result of unprotected sexual encounters vs. 28.6% from injecting drug use, 2012)
•	HIV affecting mainly the working age population. 

The Round 10 HIV grants aim to address the needs of MARPs and PLWHA and other people most affected by the HIV epidemic by scaling-up and ensuring equitable access to comprehensive HIV prevention, treatment, care and support; strengthening health systems for sustainable solutions and strengthening community systems that enable needs-based and cost-effective interventions. 

The Phase 2 proposal of the Round 10 grants takes into account the changing country context and epidemic trends and is aligned with the newly designed National HIV/AIDS Program 2014-2018 (NAP). The strategic strengths of the NAP are that it addresses both medical and social and community services and provides for the integration and decentralisation of HIV/AIDS services. In line with goals of the NAP, the main priorities for the Phase 2 are to expand prevention services and scale-up treatment, care and support services; emphasise the stewardship role of the government; effectively decentralise social and medical services; ensure equity and a strong community voice; and develop adequate mechanisms for quality assurance and M&E. 

Program implementation is conducted on a ‘dual track’ basis. There are three Principal Recipients, including two non-governmental organisations – the International HIV/AIDS Alliance in Ukraine (Alliance) and the All-Ukrainian Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS (Network) – and one governmental organization, the newly created Ukrainian Center for Disease Control (UCDC). Alliance is primarily responsible for prevention activities and SMT program implementation; the Network provides care and support activities, coordinates efforts to reduce stigma and discrimination, and works with communities on system strengthening; whereas UCDC is in charge of overall coordination, health system strengthening, and facility-based service provision.

TB constitutes a considerable public health problem: in 2007, 2189 TB patients died. The TB burden is borne by the entire population, but especially by higher risk populations such as the urban and rural poor, people with living with HIV/AIDS living and those in congregate settings. There is also a significant socio-economic consequence as the highest prevalence is among the most economically productive age range of 15-45 years. The Round 9 grant has been consolidated with the Round 5 with a Single Stream of Funding (SSF) and the principal focus is to provide increased and equitable access to DOTS services and strengthening TB/HIV collaboration. This also aims to reduce the TB burden by complementing and accelerating the activities on-going by government and other partners.

DOTS expansion and enhancement: DOTS expansion was the central focus of the Global Fund Round 5 grant and is additionally supported by contributions from government, USAID and other funding partners; however, the accessibility of DOTS services still falls short of global targets. This consolidated grant will expand upon ongoing activities, striving to provide improved and equitable access to TB services to all populations, in line with the National TB Strategic Plan and the STOP TB strategy. Additional 1,650 new DOTS centers will be established with a specific effort to engage all care providers: public, private, and community organizations. This will include strengthening of the existing laboratories and implementing Public Private Mix (PPM) model. To reduce poverty-related barriers to access, expansion will prioritize to focus more in areas with less number of centers per population while also considering geographic distribution. An appropriate number of men and women will be trained as healthcare providers in order to address gender equality issues as well as cultural and religious preferences. The monitoring and evaluation system will be strengthened and enhanced

TB/HIV collaborative activities: There has been a substantial increase in the number of TB patients accessing HCT and other HIV services in the last two years due to support from PEPFAR and Global Fund Round 5 grants and TB-CAP; however, the proportion of DOTS centers (18%) providing such services and the number of patients accessing them are still below the national target. In addition, in most instances TB infection control measures are either weak or neglected. The grant therefore aims at complementing other support structures through expansion of HCT services to 1650 additional DOTS centers, provision of CPT at DOTS centers for HIV+ TB patients, provision of IPT for HIV/AIDS patients, strengthening referral linkages with HIV service points, and improved implementation of TB infection control measures.","False","False","Transaction",,"47045-NGA-T-ARFH","global-fund"

The number of targeted communes and neighborhoods nearly doubles. A new subprogram addresses basic infrastructure and social service needs of the most isolated rural communes in mountainous areas. Finally, the design of INDH 2 also benefits from lessons learned from global experience with Community-driven development (CDD) operations as captured in two recent draft World Bank reports that have looked at the accumulated evidence on the impacts of such programs. As these reports highlight, the success of CDD programs in delivering upon their intended development objectives has depended on several factors, including (a) establishing a more participatory and inclusive model of service delivery; (b) provision of high-quality and adequate facilitation and technical assistance; (c) capacity building for communities; (d) utilization of poverty maps to target resources to poor areas; (e) block grants of sufficient size over several years, which are used for economically productive purposes; and (f) flexibility in project design and implementation with an approach to 'growth in learning' over the medium and longer term.

About the Livestock Vaccine Innovation Fund
The LVIF is a partnership between the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Global Affairs Canada (formerly Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada), and the International Development Research Centre. It represents a joint investment of CA$57 million over five years to support the development, production, and commercialization of innovative vaccines against priority livestock diseases in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia.

More specifically, the LVIF will support innovation and research to increase the efficacy, marketability, and use of existing vaccines, develop new vaccines against priority livestock diseases, and build effective research and public-private partnerships to accelerate the registration, commercialization, and use of vaccines. 

The research will also lead to a better understanding of disease dynamics and their impact, as well as the issues that constrain poor farmers from using vaccines. By bringing together all stakeholders - from farmers to researchers, pharmaceutical companies, and regulators - the LVIF will foster a vibrant and sustainable livestock sector in the target regions.

Ellas han manifestado las condiciones de rechazo de las que son víctimas por su condición de violadas y que las conduce a tomar decisiones inadecuadas para subsistir, como en este caso refugiarse en la prostitución o la mendicidad. El programa tiene como objetivo contribuir a la reintegración social de esta población afectada en Kalemie. Para ello será necesario brindar un espacio a las mujeres, denominado ?Casa de la Mujer? que les permita desarrollarse de manera integral, vale decir no sólo brindar acogida en el momento de crisis de las mujeres, sino potenciar sus capacidades para que ellas puedan sobreponerse a los momentos traumáticos de los cuales han sido víctimas y sean capaces de generar condiciones de autosuficiencia que no denigren su integridad como ser humano. El periodo de ejecución del programa es 24 meses: En el primer y segundo semestre se priorizarán las actividades de construcción e implementación de la Casa de la mujer, así como la puesta en marcha de las actividades formativas y de acompañamiento para mujeres.

Although some low- and middle-income countries invest considerable resources in building scientific capacity, the majority have weak scientific capacity. But, there are signs of change in how governments support and promote public science. New science granting councils, new directions, and new partnerships merit further investigation. 

For example, countries such as Panama have created new agencies to fund science and innovation. In the face of change, other countries, such as Egypt and others affected by the Arab Spring, are rethinking their existing science policies and support instruments. Finally, countries with significant scientific capabilities such as South Africa, Brazil, and China may begin or increase support to scientific research outside their borders.

UNU-WIDERs mandat är (i) att bedriva multidisciplinär forskning och policyanalys om hur strukturella förändringar påverkar levnadsförhållanden för världens fattigaste befolkningar, (ii) att ge ett forum för professionell interaktion och opinionsbildning, samt (iii) att främja kapacitetsförstärkning och utbildning inom området för den ekonomiska och sociala politiken. UNU-WIDER är känt för att reagera snabbt på nya frågor, sätta relevanta prioriteringar, och driva forskning av hög kvalitet. Förutom forskning, utför UNU-WIDER undervisning, utbildning och kapacitetsstärkning, samt utvecklar och tillhandahåller databaser. Resultaten omfattar ett högt antal publikationer, föreläsningar, presentationer, konferenser, samt policy-påverkan. UNU-WIDERs aktiviteter finansieras genom avkastning från en särskild donationsfond (Sverige har via UD lämnat bidrag till denna fond) samt icke öronmärkt programstöd från Sida. Vidare lämar DFID, Danida och Finland oöronmärkt stöd. Enstaka projektbidrag lämnas av andra givare och institutionella partner. Sida har stött UNU-WIDER med icke öronmärkt programstöd och olika projektstöd sedan 2003. Bidraget i föregående avtalsperiod (2010-2013) var 20 miljoner kronor (5 miljoner per år) icke öronmärkt programstöd och 27 miljoner projektstöd till programmet Research and Comminication on Foreign Aid.

UNU-WIDER har ansökt om fortsatt finansiering från Sida och lämnat in sitt arbetsprogram så kallade Work Programme 2014-2018 för “Transformation, Inequality, and Sustainability. Creating and Sharing Knowledge for Development”. Det övergripande målet för det femåriga programmet är att producera policyrelevant forskning av hög kvalitet som tas upp av berörda stakeholders som leder till förbättrad ekonomisk och social politik.

Sida bedömer att programmet är relevant för målet för Sveriges utvecklingssamarbete och att UNU-WIDER har alla förutsättningar att styra insatsen mot överenskomna mål. Därför föreslås att bidra till genomförandet av UNU-WIDERs program med en icke-öronmärkt programstöd med totalt 33,5 miljoner kronor (6,7 miljoner per år).

Sveriges stöd kommer att sammanföras med stödet från DFID, Danida och Finland. En harmoniserad rapportering och gemensamt givarmöte ska användas i uppföljningen av insatsen. 

Det finns i dagsläget inget förhandlat avtalsformat med UNU-WIDER. Med åberopande av Sidas regel för insatshantering § 2.8 har föreslaget avtalsutkast beaktat regelns krav så långt det varit möjligt. Detta mot bakgrund av att UNU-WIDER är en del av FN-systemet och att Sverige är medlem i FN. Utkastet har tagits fram i samarbete med JUR och som underlag har mallen för stat till stat-samarbete använts.","True","True","Transaction",,"SE-0-SE-6-5410005601-GGG-43082","SE"

The resulting 59 sub-projects contributed to the improved capacity of Zimbabweans to exercise their civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights. Change in Zimbabwe during the Fund’s life related to human rights, governance, democracy and gender equality. For example, legislative advocacy by ZCSF partners contributed to the enactment of the Domestic Violence Act of Zimbabwe in 2007 – thereby improving women’s rights through identification, reporting, prevention, mitigation and redress of violence against women. CIDA’s funding and technical assistance to selected civil society organizations enabled them to conduct countrywide human rights campaigns including child rights, and voter education from January 2007 to March 2008. Thereafter, civil society networks and ZCSF partners have noted that between June 2008 and May 2009 reported cases of child sexual abuse dropped by 25% to 30%. In addition, parallel tabulation by civic groups on the results of the March 2008 elections minimised opportunities for manipulation of the results, helping bring about the Global Political Agreement later that year, followed by the formation of a Government of National Unity (GNU) in February 2009. Relative peace and security for the people have emanated from the GNU. Gender equity among elected leaders has improved, in part due to the combined effects of voter education and increased awareness of women’s rights. In 2005, the percentage of elected women councillors in Local Government was 15% while males constituted 85%. Following the March 2008 Local Government elections, female councillors dramatically increased to 46% of the elected councillors. The 2010 Constitution consultation process saw remarkable public participation with good representation of youth and women, and improved access of the media to report on the outcomes of the consultation sessions. The relative success of these public consultations can be attributed to a healthy, active and engaged civil society; a result of CIDA's support through the ZCSF and a testament to the resilience of Zimbabwe’s civil society and their commitment to democracy.","False","False","Budget",1,"CA-3-A032822001","CA"

Through investments in applied research, the CIFSRF contributes to the development of more productive, sustainable, and gender-sensitive agricultural techniques for women subsistence farmers, with the ultimate goal of making food sources more secure and accessible, and the food produced more nutritious, for poor households. Women and girls are particularly targeted by this project since they face the heaviest burden of chronic hunger and malnutrition in developing countries.  The objectives of the CIFSRF are: (1) to increase food security in developing countries by funding applied research in agricultural development and nutrition; (2) to apply Canadian science and technology expertise in collaboration with developing country partners to address food security; (3) to use research results to inform food security policies and programs; and (4) to identify innovations and scale up the most promising research from both Phase I and Phase II of the Fund to help meet future global food demand. Phase II focuses geographically on the 20 countries already targeted under Phase I as well as all other official development assistance-eligible countries in Africa.  Project activities for phase II include: (1) developing farming methods that can better withstand the effects of climate change; (2) developing environmentally sustainable gender-sensitive, farmer-led research models for breeding and distribution of new crops or underutilized traditional crops and consumption of sufficient, safe and nutritious food; (3) improving family-based aquaculture; (4) decreasing domestic animal losses through development of vaccines; and (5) reducing post-harvest losses through adaptable and affordable technologies.  Partnership is an important aspect of the CIFSRF and all the research projects funded are jointly conducted by Canadian and developing country-based organizations, such as academic institutions, private sector organizations, civil society organizations, or research institutions. These partnerships harness Canada's expertise in agriculture and nutritional science and combine it with first-hand knowledge and expertise in developing countries, to maximize the benefit for development activities.","False","False","Budget",1,"CA-3-S065756001","CA"

2013,,10,,110,"C01",173043.882436,"Research into Open Educational Resources for Development",111,11110,,"Higher education plays an important role in helping developing countries reach their development goals. Yet, higher education institutions in many developing countries face a number of challenges. Among them is the growing demand for postsecondary education when most universities lack sufficient funds, human resources, and up-to-date curricula. To put it into context, the number of undergraduate and graduate students in China has grown at approximately 30% per year since 1999, yet the supply of quality postsecondary educational opportunities has not kept pace.

One potentially effective response to these challenges is open educational resources (OER). The Hewlett Foundation defines OERs as ""teaching, learning, and research resources that reside in the public domain or have been released under an intellectual property license that permits their free use and re-purposing by others."" OERs are gaining significant reach globally thanks in part to greater access to the Internet and new flexible intellectual property licenses. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) created one of the world's first OERs (MIT OpenCourseWare) by putting course materials, syllabi, and lectures freely online. The site receives over one million visits per month, of which 27% originate from East and South Asia alone.

While OERs are receiving considerable attention in universities, education ministries, and among donors, questions remain about the extent to which OERs help meet the demands for high quality tertiary education in developing countries. Research is needed to move beyond the rhetoric and to establish whether OERs bridge the educational gap, and if so, how.

The Researching Open Educational Resources for Development (ROER4D) project is a global research network on OERs and development. The University of Cape Town in South Africa coordinates the network, which includes 12 sub-projects in South America, sub-Saharan Africa, and Asia. ROER4D seeks to improve our understanding of the use and impacts of OERs in developing countries. More specifically, the project will:
- build an empirical knowledge base on the use and impact of OERs for postsecondary education;
- develop researchers' capacity to analyze open educational resources;
- build a network of scholars focused on the contributions of OERs; and

School feeding is considered to be a safety net which can help to alleviate extreme poverty and severe food insecurity on poor populations in rural and remoted areas. School feeding helps also increasing school children enrolment and attendance rates, contributing to overall improvement in school performance.

School feeding standards, which were identified jointly by WFP and the World Bank, include a policy framework, institutional capacity and coordination, financial capacity, design and implementation, and community participation. Coordinating with the government and stakeholders, WFP was helping to find sustainable solutions for a nationally-owned school feeding programme through: (i) increasing institutional and human capital development at central and local levels related to policy and management of the school feeding programme; and (ii) strengthening linkages between local agricultural production and school meals, by providing technical assistance to the government and partners.

The school feeding project fits within WFPs strategic plan 2014-2017 and contributes to WFPs Strategic Objectives 3 ""Reduce risk and enable people, communities and countries to meet their own food nutrition needs"", and 4 ""Reduce undernutrition and break the intergenerational cycle of hunger"".

This is not only to improve commercial operations, but to regain the population's confidence in the power sector and to reestablish political stability. Energy security through generation capacity expansion is a priority, but the short-term solutions are to improve system efficiency and reliability, and to enhance regional power trade. The proposed Project contributes to attaining the goals through the following components:

(i) Automated Metering and Data Acquisition system (AMDA) will bring transparency to the wholesale electricity transaction between the unbundled power companies as well as in regional power trade. AMDA will eliminate errors and rampant metering data manipulation that are untraceable by the current archaic technology. Loss reduction will make more power available domestically and also improve the financial performance of the power companies. Accurate power flow data is indispensible to improve the power companies  commercial operation performance. The system also enhances regional power trade through (i) meeting the CAPS metering accuracy requirement, and (ii) eliminating unauthorized export.

(ii) Substation Rehabilitation will improve reliability of the Kyrgyz power system by replacing dilapidated circuit-breakers and instrument transformers that have reached their economic lives, are technologically obsolete, or do not meet the accuracy requirement for regional power trade. Since the Kyrgyz system is intricately interconnected with the Central Asia Power System (CAPS), rehabilitation increases reliability of the regional system and enhance regional power trade. 

(iii) Communications and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system will link seven major substations (estimated) and the control centers via optical fiber, and enables the system operator to make efficient dispatching based on real-time data. The scope is limited to system monitoring function of the northern loop. SCADA will reduce technical losses through avoidance of overloading, and also enable faster detection and restoration of faults. The system improves the overall efficiency and reliability of the Kyrgyz system and CAPS.

(iv) Study on Electricity Settlement Center will study the settlement systems appropriate to bring about transparency and accountability to the Kyrgyz power sector, and to maximize the benefits of the AMDA. It will devise mechanisms to publish data on energy flows and manage distribution of sector revenues in a transparent manner.

(v) Corporate and Financial Management Capacity Building for the National Electric Grid of Kyrgyzstan (NEGK) will improve corporate management through the preparation of a corporate business plan including the review of investment needs, operation and maintenance practices, organizational reforms, internal control, asset revaluation, and cost of transmission service. Financial management capacity will be strengthened through introduction of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and appropriate corporate accounting software.

Under component 1 the school meals programme aims to i) increase attendance rates in primary school children; ii) reduce of drop-out rates amongst primary school children, particularly girls; and iii) enhance government capacity to monitor and manage school feeding activities. School feeding is part of broader school health and nutrition programmes that have proven to provide a vital safety net for children in terms of nutrition, education and health.

Component 2 aims to improve the nutritional situation of targeted categories of vulnerable people, including selected children aged 6 to 59 months, selected pregnant and lactating women and assisted malnourished clients on anti-retroviral treatment (ART) or TB clients. WFP's approach to nutrition takes into consideration the results of the SMART and EFSA assessments that took place in 2015, which demonstrated that the nutritional status of already vulnerable groups is further exacerbated by factors such as infectious diseases, parasitic disorders and food insecurity, especially among children. WFP has also been working to provide food assistance to malnourished clients on ART and TB clients to improve treatment adherence and has continued to shape its nutrition assistance in such a way that it addresses acute and chronic under nutrition through both the treatment of Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM) and the prevention of acute malnutrition, micronutrient deficiencies and chronic malnutrition; as well as facilitating a coherent coordination of nutrition interventions that are in place, in part facilitated by the REACH and SUN.       

Through Component 3, WFP supports rural communities to boost agricultural production, helping to reduce their vulnerability. This activity supports mainly women farmers groups that specialize in vegetable gardens - to increase their production and supply school canteens supported by WFP with fresh vegetables (including spinach, green pepper, okra, onions, etc). Under component 1, WFP is also supporting local rice farmers by purchasing locally produced parboiled rice from them for the school meals activity.","False","False","Transaction",,"XM-DAC-41140-200326","wfp"

The recovery component also promoted local production by linking small farmers' organizations to school meals and to the provision of food assistance to refugees.

In all activities, WFP aimed to improve awareness and understanding of good nutrition and, therefore, prior to the receipt of their entitlements, all beneficiaries supported through GFD, FFA and FFT participated in nutrition trainings and could exchange vouchers only for nutritious food.

One of the objectives of the CIFSRF is to ensure that the results generated by the research funded are used to inform food security policies, programs, and on-the-ground development activities. Partnership is also an important aspect of the CIFSRF. All the research projects funded are jointly conducted by Canadian and developing country-based organizations, such as academic institutions, private sector organizations, civil society organizations, or research institutions.

Despite increased openness to evidence-based policymaking, local funding for Latin American policy research institutions is extremely limited and often partisan. Except in Peru (and universities in general), policy research organizations are relatively young and face challenges common to newly established institutions anywhere: difficulties in establishing a focused research agenda, problems in attracting and retaining staff and governance issues.

This grant will strengthen the ability of the 12 selected research institutions to provide, disseminate and communicate high-quality research. This will be achieved through measures aimed at enhancing the ability of staff to conduct sound research, improving organizational governance, and communicating with policymakers. Particular effort will be made to enable grantees to mobilize other sources of funding, so that none become dependent on the Think Tank Initiative over the long term. The project will also support a platform for grantee networking both within the Initiative and with a wider network of institutions engaged in policy-related research.

Since its creation in 2002, the Global Fund has become the main global financier of programs to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, with approved funding of US$30 billion for more than 1,000 programs in more than 140 countries. The Global Fund is one of Canada’s key partners to improve the health of mothers and children in developing countries.

Intercommunity conflict, civilian kidnappings and criminal activities persisted in many regions, and insecurity along roads and distribution sites continued to impede humanitarian access to certain areas. The unrest in Bangui in late September 2015 caused over 48,000 people to flee their homes at a time when thousands of displaced people were in the process of returning. According to UNHCR, as of November 2015, 447,000 people were internally displaced in C.A.R., 40 percent of them located in IDP sites. 
Outside C.A.R, as of November 2014, more than 420,000 refugees, returnees, and third country nationals have taken refuge in neighboring Cameroon, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and Republic of Congo (RoC). Populations arriving in Cameroon came with no belongings; adults and children arrived with illnesses and injuries, and many suffering malnutrition after a long journey without food, water, or shelter. In Chad, the population profile was mixed, including both refugees and a large proportion of persons considered by the Chadian government to be returnees. In DRC, refugees settled in remote territories, where they lacked reliable livelihoods or coping mechanisms to meet basic food needs and, in host areas with an already precarious food security situation. Similarly, refugees arriving in RoC, who showed signs of moderate and acute malnutrition, were settled in two sites. 

Regional Emergency Operation 200799 (EMOP) responds to the life-saving needs of populations affected by the ongoing crisis in C.A.R. and its regional impact in Cameroon, Chad, DRC and RoC. The regional operation focused on ensuring life-saving needs of vulnerable populations in conflict-affected communities, the displaced and refugee/returnee sites. The operation is in line with Strategic Objective 1, ""Save lives and protect livelihoods in emergencies"" and aimed to: (i) improve food consumption and access to markets; (ii) stabilize undernutrition; and (iii) restore access to basic services. Elements fostering social cohesion, investment in human capital, and support for agricultural production alongside partners are integrated into the life-saving response.

In 2015 the social-political environment in C.A.R. remained extremely complex, and was characterized by continued sporadic surges of extreme violence against a backdrop of a survival economy and fragmented armed groups. The crisis led to large population displacements and severe humanitarian and economic implications as livelihoods and trade were disrupted or destroyed. Household assets and reserves were being depleted and the scale and severity of food insecurity levels among the population became unprecedented. Volatile security, inaccessibility, restrictions on movement and reduced presence of staff and partners in field locations remained important obstacles to meeting targets. Against this backdrop, the EMOP aimed to: (i) refine and re-focus targeting based on latest assessments - with a focus on rural areas; (ii) diversify activities and modalities to provide flexible seasonal support to moderately food-insecure households; (iii) support restoration of access to basic services and human capital protection; (iv) strengthen and stabilize the WFP country and sub-office staffing structure; and (v) reinforce supply chain management and alternative corridors to meet high monthly tonnage requirements.
The regional focus allowed to reaffirm visibility and a common advocacy around the crisis and its regional implications, while supporting a more equitable distribution of resources across the five countries. Beyond the programmatic response, the regional lens also reinforced a broader view of supply chain management of the operation, recognizing shared challenges and opportunities.","False","False","Transaction",,"XM-DAC-41140-200799-SNRB","wfp"

2013,"CO",10,,110,"B02",531305,"Integrated Approach to Address Food Insecurity among Highly Vulnerable Households Affected by Displacement and Violence in Colombia",112,11230,,"Colombia is nearly self-sufficient in terms of food availability with well-integrated markets. However, in areas affected by conflict and violence, armed groups restrict trade and disturb supply chains, increasing transaction costs and prices. The objective of the PRRO is to improve access to food and dietary diversity of people affected by the armed conflict with high levels of food insecurity. Special attention was given to ethnic minorities including Afro-Colombian and indigenous people, who represent nearly half of the total beneficiaries assisted, due to their higher level of poverty and illiteracy, social exclusion, and lower access to food than the rest of the population.

During the first quarter of 2015, in consultation with Government's Department for Social Prosperity (DPS), the Colombian Institute of Family Welfare (ICBF) and the Colombian Presidential Agency for International Cooperation (APC), WFP aligned its activities to meet the future needs of populations in the emerging post-conflict scenario. The inclusion of WFP beneficiary households in social-protection programmes is promoted through government counterparts in the field who linked beneficiaries to the available local social programmes. These relationships and government resources have allowed WFP to reach more beneficiaries with nutrition-sensitive complementary assistance for children under 5 and pregnant and lactating women (PLW) through relief. Subsequently, as part of the integrated approach, beneficiaries participated in recovery activities including training on healthy lifestyles and adequate handling and preparation of food through recovery assistance.

Aligned with WFP Strategic Objective 1, the relief component focused on ensuring access to sufficient quantity and quality of food allowing highly food-insecure families to improve their food consumption; preventing deterioration of nutritional status of children under 5 and PLW and reducing micronutrient deficiencies of children under 5. WFP assistance helped preventing the recruitment of children by armed groups and retaining children in schools. 

Under WFP Strategic Objective 2, the recovery component improved the livelihoods of vulnerable displaced people following the initial period of emergency assistance through food-for-assets (FFA) and food-for-training (FFT) activities, emphasizing actions that promoted self-sufficiency in meeting food and nutrition security.

In line with WFP Strategic Objective 3, and building on the use of vouchers in food assistance programmes, WFP launched an initiative to test food-assistance models that allow WFP beneficiaries to buy food locally produced by smallholder farmers using WFP provided electronic vouchers. With an emphasis on gender equality and women's empowerment, by targeting female headed farmer households while providing gender-sensitive nutrition trainings and gender equality trainings to men and women, these new models supported the Government's Family Farmers initiative to increase rural incomes while promoting dietary diversity. Results from the pilot indicate that WFP has an important role to play in leveraging purchasing power to connect smallholder farmers to markets in Colombia. 

The 3-month extension of this PRRO and the launch of the new one is in response to the changing beneficiary needs due to the ongoing peace negotiations, and redirection of government policies. WFP also aimed to increase efficiency using vouchers linked to local purchases, which reduced time needed by beneficiaries to receive assistance and at the same time promoted local production benefiting smallholder farmers' associations. Capacity development actions were introduced to strengthen local governments; to increase the ability to respond to natural disasters; to support boarding schools to fill the gaps in the national school meals programme and to purchase quinoa to introduce traditional nutritious food.","False","False","Transaction",,"XM-DAC-41140-200148","wfp"

Also known as corn, maize is an essential food source for Ethiopians. QPM is a non-genetically engineered form of maize. The maize contains a naturally derived gene mutation of maize which has a higher content of two essential amino acids necessary to synthesize proteins within the human body after consumption, and provides twice as much nutritional value as common maize.   The project supports the adoption of QPM as well as increases in farm productivity and household incomes through the expansion of the maize seed industry. Project activities include: introducing QPM seed and food products to farmers (women and men) engaged in subsistence-level maize production as a means to meet household basic food requirements; disseminating gender-sensitive crop management practices to farmers and agricultural extension officers; and strengthening local capacity of researchers, seed producers, and seed suppliers on the production, distribution, and quality control of QPM seeds.   Nutritious Maize for Ethiopia (NuME) is an initiative of the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre (CIMMYT), a member centre of the Consultative Group for International Agriculture Research (CGIAR).

In India, recent figures from the National Sample Survey Organization (2012) suggest that there are approximately 1.5 billion micro-enterprises, many of them  owned by women and home-based. 

Findings from IDRC-supported studies on female micro-entrepreneurs in Mumbai and Chennai suggest a correlation between economic growth and the adoption of mobile phones. When they are able to use mobile communications, many of these women-owned micro-enterprises increase their revenues and hire additional workers. The findings also suggest that successful female micro-entrepreneurs enjoy increased levels of self-efficiency, social respect, and power within their families.

Still, little is known about how best to use mobile phones with other common entrepreneurial tools, such as micro-loans and training. This project will assess the impact of three common interventions (microloans, entrepreneurial training, and mobile phones) on the economic growth of micro-enterprises and on the social development of the women who own them. 

This study aims to determine how efficient the interventions are-either individually or in combination-as a means to increase female micro-entrepreneur participation in developing economies. Researchers will carry out fieldwork in Coimbatore, India. A total of 320 women micro-enterprise owners will be assigned to one of three experimental groups or a control group. Researchers will collect pretest data about the participants and their micro-enterprises from all groups. 

Three main experiment stimuli will be introduced over a two-year period: data-enabled phones, business training, and microloans. Researchers will collect additional data one year after the first stimuli have been applied, followed by post-test data collection one year after the second round of stimuli. To generate rich descriptions of how household dynamics affect the perceptions and behaviours of women micro-enterprises, the research team will conduct qualitative interviews with three important persons (e.g., husbands, mothers-in-law) in the households of 20-30 female micro-entrepreneurs. 

The project intends to explain four new constructs (growth orientation, risk attitudes, perceived empowerment, and mattering or feeling important in the family dynamic) and determine their value in development studies. The research team will select and train participants in partnership with a local NGO, development agencies, and public training institutions.

Poverty, conflict, and development
Promoting development and humanitarian responses in contexts of violent conflict is complex. It is made even more difficult because poverty rates in conflict-affected states are 20 points higher on average than their impoverished, but peaceful, counterparts. Countries facing the deepest challenges are those with the least capacity to develop their own solutions. To add to the problem, donors base their funding on information provided by outside consultants hired for short-term work.

Local researchers for local solutions
This project will provide funding to develop institutional capacity at the new Resilience Innovation Hub. The hub will explore several research streams to examine why interventions succeed or fail, and how individuals, communities, and states can cope with and overcome conflict and violence. Researchers will also look at how to support peacemaking processes and increase disaster prevention efforts. Their work will respond directly to policy demands and address critical knowledge gaps.

The hub will share research results with other researchers, practitioners, the private sector, and policymakers.

During the project?s planning phase in 2014, the coffee producers identified as their major problems - in addition to climate change and the rust disease - producer organizations? weak administrative capacity, low productivity, lack of sales skills, as well as the shortage of working capital. The goal of the project in Honduras is to improve livelihood of small-scale coffee producers. The project?s purpose is to develop the country's coffee producer organizations to be more efficient and productive. The project will develop the administrative capacity of cooperatives by reviewing cooperative-specific development plans and administrational instructions, and by supporting production and implementation of youth and gender strategies. Productivity and quality of coffee will be improved by renewing coffee plants, training on quality management, improving tasting laboratories, producing organic fertilizers, and training farmers at the demonstration plots. Sales capacities will be strengthened by participating in trade fairs and developing websites.

A second competitive call was launched in 2009, and a total of 12 institutions in seven countries were selected from Latin America.

Despite increased openness to evidence-based policymaking, local funding for Latin American policy research institutions is extremely limited and often partisan. Except in Peru (and universities in general), policy research organizations are relatively young and face challenges common to newly established institutions anywhere: difficulties in establishing a focused research agenda, problems in attracting and retaining staff and governance issues.

This grant will strengthen the ability of the 12 selected research institutions to provide, disseminate and communicate high-quality research. This will be achieved through measures aimed at enhancing the ability of staff to conduct sound research, improving organizational governance, and communicating with policymakers. Particular effort will be made to enable grantees to mobilize other sources of funding, so that none become dependent on the Think Tank Initiative over the long term. The project will also support a platform for grantee networking both within the Initiative and with a wider network of institutions engaged in policy-related research.

Very often, these movements find resolution in partition or in an ethnic group/nationality getting autonomous control over the region in which it resides. This study hypothesizes that while the ideological impulse toward partition may be democratic, its consequences are undemocratic. Partition-based peace settlements may stop immediate violence, but are likely to produce endemic violence, because the root cause of the grievance - democracy deficit, not ethnicity - remains unresolved.

Building on the results of the first phase of the project (103989), researchers will endeavor to bring the voices of the vulnerable into the partition discourse 60 years after the Great Partition of 1947 (India-Pakistan). They will examine the strengths and weaknesses of the integration efforts of the resulting states, the weaknesses inherent in the practice of peacemaking under partition-based peace accords, and ways in which the consequences of partition can be made more democratic, rights enabling, and conducive to peace and security. The field-based research will be carried out in several South Asian contexts.

Being an ADB initiative, MSME development was a part of the development strategy for Maldives under the 7th National Plan 2006-2010. The impact of the project is expected to be inclusive and broad-based MSME sector. The outcome of the project will be a further expanded and strengthened MSME sector. For this purpose, the MSMEDP will focus on enhancing the business environment and support infrastructure for doing business with better knowledge, greater access to financing, and expanded business opportunities for MSMEs. The project has three components. 

The first component of MSMEDP will increase MSME access to business development services and support institutional capacity building for Business Development Services Centers (BDSCs) by (i) expanding BDSCs  geographical coverage to all seven provinces within the country; (ii) introducing new business development services (BDS) including business incubator programs offered by the BDSCs, including institutionalized support in creating and enforcing market linkages; and (iii) strengthening the institutional, infrastructural, and human resource capacity of an expanded network of BDSCs to better support BDS demand needs of MSMEs. This component will also support energy sector linkages to value chain business opportunities having potential for MSME participation. 

The second component will improve MSMEs  access to finance through (i) additional a line of credit facility (LCF) to meet with a huge credit demand from MSME sector, (ii) extension of credit information bureau to improve information quality and reduce credit risk, and (iii) establishment of secured transaction registry providing database information on fixed and movable assets. 

In line with previous PSDP implementation, information communication technology (ICT) will be managed by Bank of Maldives (BML) to promote MSME by providing them with financing for investment. The eligibility criteria for such financing includes (i) MSMEs which are registered in the MSME database; (ii) MSME activities focus on target clusters as per government policy (agricultural commercialization, fishery processing, handicrafts, and tourism-related activities which are environment impact neutral activities), and special emphasis will be given to non-traditional sectors such as ICT and renewable energy project (e.g. solar panel citizen service centers); and (iii) the MSME has adequate cash flow or enterprise budget as well as collateral.

BML will undertake an independent credit risk assessment for proposals to determine if they meet the lending criteria agreed among the government, ADB, and BML. If the credit risk assessment is satisfactory, BML will approve subloans and execute an onlending agreement. Onlending agreements will be signed between BML and the subborrower on terms and conditions, as agreed among the government, ADB, and BML. The maximum sub-loan size for individual applicants will be local currency equivalent to $80,000 and the anticipated average sub-loan size is local currency equivalent to $40,000. It is expected that BML will provide around 200 MSMEs with subloans under LCF. Any deviation will be subject to ADB prior approval. The terms of lending will be on a commercial basis at the prevailing market rates of interest and tenor, reflecting costs of raising such funds locally and guaranteeing adequate spread of interest rates for BML to cover transaction costs and risks.

So far, responses to climate threats in these regions have focused mainly on short-term solutions, such as early warning systems, famine relief, and soil and water conservation. However, long-term climate projections suggest that a more profound response will be needed by mid-century. The research team will respond to this knowledge and development gap through a program involving regional diagnostic studies, research, knowledge synthesis, and information sharing in semi-arid regions.

It will address the complex interactions between climate, biophysical, social, political, and economic dynamics. The project team will integrate research on each of these aspects through transformative scenario planning, which is an effective methodology for bringing sometimes disparate stakeholders together to address complex problems.

Building on lessons learned from previous operations, this PRRO aimed to protect livelihoods and reduce acute malnutrition, while tackling underlying causes of food insecurity and malnutrition to reduce the impact of seasonal stress and shocks. WFP provided food and nutrition assistance to cover immediate needs of vulnerable households through targeted and flexible food and nutrition safety nets while enhancing assets and skills to contribute in building long-term capacity to mitigate shocks.

WFP's intervention focused on (i) supporting beneficiaries in emergency contexts through general food distribution (GFD) and unconditional cash transfer; (ii) enhancing assets and skills of beneficiaries through Food assistance for Assets (FFA) activities; and (iii) treating and preventing acute malnutrition through targeted and blanket supplementary feeding.

Intercommunity conflict, civilian kidnappings and criminal activities persisted in many regions, and insecurity along roads and distribution sites continued to impede humanitarian access to certain areas. The unrest in Bangui in late September 2015 caused over 48,000 people to flee their homes at a time when thousands of displaced people were in the process of returning. According to UNHCR, as of November 2015, 447,000 people were internally displaced in C.A.R., 40 percent of them located in IDP sites. 
Outside C.A.R, as of November 2014, more than 420,000 refugees, returnees, and third country nationals have taken refuge in neighboring Cameroon, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and Republic of Congo (RoC). Populations arriving in Cameroon came with no belongings; adults and children arrived with illnesses and injuries, and many suffering malnutrition after a long journey without food, water, or shelter. In Chad, the population profile was mixed, including both refugees and a large proportion of persons considered by the Chadian government to be returnees. In DRC, refugees settled in remote territories, where they lacked reliable livelihoods or coping mechanisms to meet basic food needs and, in host areas with an already precarious food security situation. Similarly, refugees arriving in RoC, who showed signs of moderate and acute malnutrition, were settled in two sites. 

Regional Emergency Operation 200799 (EMOP) responds to the life-saving needs of populations affected by the ongoing crisis in C.A.R. and its regional impact in Cameroon, Chad, DRC and RoC. The regional operation focused on ensuring life-saving needs of vulnerable populations in conflict-affected communities, the displaced and refugee/returnee sites. The operation is in line with Strategic Objective 1, ""Save lives and protect livelihoods in emergencies"" and aimed to: (i) improve food consumption and access to markets; (ii) stabilize undernutrition; and (iii) restore access to basic services. Elements fostering social cohesion, investment in human capital, and support for agricultural production alongside partners are integrated into the life-saving response.

In 2015 the social-political environment in C.A.R. remained extremely complex, and was characterized by continued sporadic surges of extreme violence against a backdrop of a survival economy and fragmented armed groups. The crisis led to large population displacements and severe humanitarian and economic implications as livelihoods and trade were disrupted or destroyed. Household assets and reserves were being depleted and the scale and severity of food insecurity levels among the population became unprecedented. Volatile security, inaccessibility, restrictions on movement and reduced presence of staff and partners in field locations remained important obstacles to meeting targets. Against this backdrop, the EMOP aimed to: (i) refine and re-focus targeting based on latest assessments - with a focus on rural areas; (ii) diversify activities and modalities to provide flexible seasonal support to moderately food-insecure households; (iii) support restoration of access to basic services and human capital protection; (iv) strengthen and stabilize the WFP country and sub-office staffing structure; and (v) reinforce supply chain management and alternative corridors to meet high monthly tonnage requirements.
The regional focus allowed to reaffirm visibility and a common advocacy around the crisis and its regional implications, while supporting a more equitable distribution of resources across the five countries. Beyond the programmatic response, the regional lens also reinforced a broader view of supply chain management of the operation, recognizing shared challenges and opportunities.","False","False","Transaction",,"XM-DAC-41140-200799-TD","wfp"

2015,"BF",10,,110,"B02",601583,"Assistance to Refugees and Internally Displaced Persons Affected by Insecurity in Mali",720,72040,,"The Mali regional emergency operation was launched on 1 June 2012 in support of populations displaced by the outbreak of violence in several regions in Mali.

Initially, the operation aimed to support around 300,000 internally displaced Malians and around 255,000 refugees crossing borders into neighbouring Burkina Faso, Mauritania and Niger. Four budget revisions led to an adjustment of refugee numbers and the transition of internally displaced Malians to the Mali single country EMOP. Only refugees assisted in the three neighbouring countries stayed under the regional emergency operation, assisting 145,000 refugees overall. Burkina Faso considerably reduced its refugee numbers by shifting their focus to assisting refugees settled in official camps and not unofficial sites, and by using biometric registration provided by UNHCR to verify refugee lists. In Mauritania and Niger, refugee numbers remained stable, but towards the end of 2014, Niger stopped providing assistance to Nigerien returnees as they were meant to return to their places of origin, and only refugees received continuous assistance.

Security in northern Mali deteriorated further during 2014. Inter-Malian peace talks in Algiers convened intermittently from August to November 2014. Attacks targeting the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) and aid workers increased. Since September 2013, 31 peacekeepers have been killed and 90 wounded. In 2015 attacks continued increasing as armed groups aimed to strengthen claims for territorial autonomy by consolidating control over strategic areas ahead of and during negotiations. Reprisals against returning refugees prohibited largescale returns.

The main objectives of the EMOP are to:
(i) Support the food security of Malian refugees in Burkina Faso, Mauritania and Niger through general food distributions (GFD) using food, cash and/or voucher modalities.
(ii) Prevent and treat moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) among children aged 6-59 months and pregnant and lactating women (PLW) through blanket supplementary feeding (BSF) and targeted supplementary feeding (TSF).
(iii) Support emergency school feeding activities for refugees.

The regional EMOP's nutrition activities were aligned with and complemented WFP's Regional Response Framework for the Sahel drought. The emergency operation was aligned to WFP Strategic Objective 1 ""Save lives and protect livelihoods in emergencies"" and contributed toward Millennium Development Goals 1 ""Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger"", 4 ""Reduce child mortality"" and 5 ""Improve maternal health.""

The EMOP was modified twice in 2015: in January, to extend its duration for twelve months, from 1 January to 31 December 2015, to accommodate continuing needs of Malian refugees (budget revision 7); and in October 2015, to include additional needs that resulted from the delays in the deactivation process (budget revision 8).

However, the current potential is 40 000 and numbers of workers are still in the increase. For the union to get to negotiations in more companies, recruitment of members still needs to be continued and intensified. According to the Namibian law each company must have at least half of the workers organized (meaning the so called ?50 % +1? rule), in order to gain official recognition for the union as negotiation partner. Most of the agreements are at company level and national minimum levels are a rarity. MANWU is therefore a pioneer influencing the entire negotiation system that has managed to negotiate national minimum level for the construction sector. Now the objective is to achieve the same in the metal sector, but this requires wider company level coverage. Through the project MANWU also aims at financial and operational self-sustainability by increasing its membership and intensifying dues collection.  The increased negotiation power and improved knowhow produce better collective agreements, improve the quality of life of workers in terms of income level and occupational health and safety and strengthen the workers? rights awareness.

The Initiative selected the first cohort of 24 grantees in East and West Africa through a competitive call in 2008-2009. A second competitive call was launched in 2009, targeting seven countries in Latin America and five countries in South Asia (Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka). Of the 16 successful applicants from South Asia, nine are in India.

Policy research in South Asia is dominated by India. A long tradition of independent research exists there thanks to the strong demand from policymakers in search  of ideas and advice. Local funding is available, but as in other regions, this tends to be project-based and is moving away from support to the social sciences. Institutions are struggling to maintain high quality research and to communicate their results effectively.

This grant will strengthen the ability of the nine research institutions in India to provide, disseminate and communicate high-quality research. It will do so through measures aimed at enhancing the ability of staff to conduct sound research, improving organizational performance and forging links with policymakers. Particular effort will be made to enable grantees to mobilize other sources of funding, so that none become dependent on the Think Tank Initiative over the long term. The project will also support a platform for grantee networking both within the Initiative and with a wider network of institutions engaged in policy-related research.
